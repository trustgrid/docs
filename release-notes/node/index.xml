Previously the Hop Monitoring ran every 20 seconds providing only 3 samples per minute. This was not enough to provide accurate data for some applications. This release increases the sample rate to every 5 seconds. This allows the Hop Monitoring to provide accurate data for applications that require a high sample rate.</description></item><item><title>January 2025 Minor Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2025-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2025-01/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20250109-2213 20250109-221438.4c724ae n-2.21.1 Other Improvements and Fixes Fixes an issue where connections to the Trustgrid control plane could get stuck in a CLOSE_WAIT state. This could cause the node to show as disconnect despite a working data plane connection. Adds an early release feature to allow clustered Azure-based appliances to manage a floating, local cluster IP address similar to on-premises appliances. Currently there is no UI support for this feature.</description></item><item><title>October 2024 Major Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-10/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20241010-2172 20241010-161952.c6810b2 n-2.21.0 Force Node Health Check Refresh In the July 2024 cloud release Trustgrid exposed warnings in the portal if a node was unable to connect to its configured DNS server, the Trustgrid update repository (repo), or if SSH had been reconfigured to listen on an IP other than localhost. These health checks run automatically at the following times:
Repo Connectivity is checked every 24 hours DNS Resolution runs hourly SSH Lockdown is checked when the node service first starts With this release, rather than waiting for the health checks to rerun and update the state of each check you can now force the node to rerun each check.</description></item><item><title>July 2024 Major Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-07-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-07-2/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20240719-2112 20240719-202719.9cf7134 n-2.20.0 Configuration Retrieval Improvements Appliances retrieve their configuration from the control plane services. Before this release, it was not obvious if a node was unable to pull down its configuration which could lead to unexpected behavior. Two improvements have been made:
A new event called Configuration Update Failure has been created that the appliance will send if it is unable to connect to the configuration control plane API endpoint.</description></item><item><title>July 2024 Minor Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-07/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-07/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20240704-2096 20240704-010918.2.b2a86bf n-2.19.3 Dynamic Routing Issue A recent release broke the ability of a node to announce a VPN Dynamic route to a peer.

This change limits abnormal disconnect messages to only be sent from the client to avoid excessive alert notifications on the gateway server.
VPN Communication with Out-of-date Peers A recently release version of the appliance introduced an unexpected change that caused out-of-date clients, running versions from early 2021 or older, to receive VPN packets they could not process.</description></item><item><title>March 2024 Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-03/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20240306-1999 20240306-161006.62ba5a5 n-2.19.0 Dynamic Access Policy Evaluation Previously Access Policies were only evaluated at the time a flow was created. With this release, access policies will be re-evaluated in realtime for active flows. This allows dynamically changing policies to immediately take effect without requiring existing flows to timeout or reset.
System Resources Overview Appliances running this release will now share with the control plane the number of CPU cores, total system memory (RAM), and total disk size.</description></item><item><title>February 2024 Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/2024-02/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20240203-1968 20240203-071412.8f765f6 n-2.18.0 Removal of Local UI System The local UI functionality allowed users with direct physical access to an appliance network port to connect to a lightweight web server on the appliance to change the WAN interface IP and see the connectivity status. Several years ago, this solution was augmented with the Console Utility which has proved easier to use and has been expanded to provide much more functionality.</description></item><item><title>December 2023 Appliance Minor Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/dec-2023-minor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/dec-2023-minor/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20231206-1914 20231206-183238.65d2bde n-2.17.3 Disable UDP Rekeying A customer had a misconfiguration that led to the UDP rekeying messages being lost. This compounded the performance impact as the UDP tunnels had to be rebuilt frequently.
This release adds the ability for Trustgrid support to disable UDP rekeying on a gateway if needed. Trustgrid will make the UDP rekeying process more resilient and better able to handle lost key exchanges in the future.</description></item><item><title>November 2023 Appliance Minor Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/nov-2023-minor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/nov-2023-minor/</guid><description> Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20231122-1901 20231122-215335.d942235 n-2.17.2 Resolved Issues Fixes an issue introduced in the October 2023 release that caused the end time of flow logs to be incorrect Fixes an issue that prevented registering nodes in newer AWS regions</description></item><item><title>October 2023 Appliance Second Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/oct-2023-1-minor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/oct-2023-1-minor/</guid><description> Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20231017-1855 20231017-165331.5772aac n-2.17.1 Resolved Issues Fixed an issue where the appliance would stop responding to SNMP traffic on the virtual management IP if virtual network port forwards were configured.</description></item><item><title>October 2023 Appliance Release Notes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/oct-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/oct-2023/</guid><description>Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20231003-1842 20231003-145438.e8103a2 n-2.17.0 Support for running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS This release adds support for running the Trustgrid node appliance on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for new deployments on AWS, Azure and vSphere.
