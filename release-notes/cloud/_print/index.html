This works much like the existing <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/operations/flow-logs/#flow-log-export>S3 Flow Log Export</a> and requires the same bucket policy and versioning settings. To have this setup contact Trustgrid support.</li><li>Changes to Container settings now include the name of the container instead of its unique ID.</li><li>Changes to a policy will now show what resources are covered by the policy.</li><li>Group deletion is now audited with name.</li><li>Authentication records using a configured <a href>Identity Provider(IdP)</a> now include the IdP used.</li><li>The advanced search now allows you to select more object types.</li></ul><h2 id=l4-proxy-ui-improvements>L4 Proxy UI Improvements</h2><p>This release also makes several improvements to the UI for configuring and managing our Layer 4 (L4) proxy <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/services/>Services</a> and <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/connectors/>Connectors</a>.</p><p>These improvement include:</p><ul><li>More consistency in the names of fields between the add/edit prompt and the table listings.</li><li>The addition of links to <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/services/#test-connectivity>automatically test connectivity of a TCP service</a> and <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/connectors/#sniff-traffic>sniff traffic for a connector listening port</a></li><li>Removal of the Services Health Check feature. This attribute has been removed from the Add Service prompt and the Services table. Any service that previously had this set to <code>Enabled</code> will continue performing this health check until the service is updated.

This should enable us to more tightly integrate the portal UI with related documentation.</p><p>As a start, we&rsquo;ve created a link called Documentation under the Management section of the main navigation bar that will open the docs in a new tab.</p><p>Additionally, we&rsquo;ve created a section for release notes that will allow you to monitor release for <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/cloud/>Control Plane</a> and <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/node/>Node</a> releases via RSS feeds going forward.</p><h3 id=swagger-api-documentation-move>Swagger API Documentation Move</h3><p>As part of this change we are moving our API documentation from <a href=https://portal.trustgrid.io/api-docs/>https://portal.trustgrid.io/api-docs/</a> to <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/api/>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/api/</a>. This will allow updating this documentation outside our normal release process.</p><h2 id=cluster-configuration>Cluster Configuration</h2><p>Prior to this release it was necessary to navigate to each member node and configure the <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/cluster/#heartbeat>cluster heartbeat</a> IP and port <strong>after</strong> it was added to the cluster. In this release a prompt has been added to the <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/clusters/manage-members/#add-members>&ldquo;Add Node&rdquo; flow</a> that will allow you to configure these settings as part of adding the node to the cluster.</p><h2 id=data-plane-stats>Data Plane Stats</h2><p>This release further improves on our recent addition of data plane telemetry information.</p><ul><li>Show data plane telemetry for offline nodes</li><li>Show data plane telemetry for connections between public and private gateways</li></ul><h2 id=virtual-network-route-table>Virtual Network Route Table</h2><p>Virtual Network Route Tables can now be sorted by Destination, Destination CIDR or Metric.

If the container was configured to run as a service this would cause the container to start immediately. This could create issues if additional changes were desired before the container attempts to start, such as creating volumes or adjusting environment variables. With this release the container is imported in a Disabled state and will need to be enabled once you are ready to use the container.</p><h3 id=import-container-volumes>Import Container Volumes</h3><p>There is a new Action available under Container Management > Volumes to Import. This will enable you to import configured volumes configured on another node or cluster. This will simplify configuring containers that require several volumes to be defined.</p><p>(Note: Just like with container configuration import, the source must match the destination type. A node can import from another node and a cluster can import from another cluster)</p><div class="alert alert-primary" role=alert><h4 class=alert-heading>Note:</h4>Just like with container configuration import, the source must match the destination type. A node can import from another node and a cluster can import from another cluster</div><h2 id=flow-logs>Flow Logs</h2><h3 id=flow-log-ordering>Flow Log Ordering</h3><p>Our flow logs have historically been searched starting with the oldest in the time range first. This sometimes forced you to load more results multiple times to see the most current information. With this release we now can search either with oldest or newest first. By default the Flow Logs page will now show the last two hours with the most recent first.</p><p>Additionally, in the Advanced Search there is a new option to select the <code>Flow Log Order</code> depending on your needs.</p><figure class=centered-image><img src=FlowLogOrderOption.png alt style=display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%><figcaption style=text-align:center;margin-top:.5rem;font-weight:lighter>Flow Log Order selector</figcaption></figure><h3 id=flow-log-s3-export>Flow Log S3 Export</h3><p>Previously Trustgrid had a mechanism to export flow logs to an AWS S3 bucket on a nightly basis. This was determined to be insufficient for our customers who wanted closer to real-time access to this data. With this release Trustgrid can configur near real-time S3 to S3 replication with our new <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/operations/flow-logs/#flow-log-export>Flow Log Export</a> system.</p><h3 id=flow-csv-export-date-format>Flow CSV Export Date Format</h3><p>Trustgrid has long supported the option to export your current view of the Flow Logs to a CSV file. However, the format of dates was difficult to parse using most spreadsheet applications. With this release both the start time and end time (if available) is reported in a human readable format like <code>dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.000</code> and in Unix Timestamp Milliseconds (MS). This should make analysis of the records much easier and more precise.</p><figure class=centered-image><img src=flow-log-csv-date.png alt="text CSV export example showing 'startTime' and 'startTimeMS' fields" style=display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:40%><figcaption style=text-align:center;margin-top:.5rem;font-weight:lighter>Example CSV export</figcaption></figure><h2 id=upgrade-improvements>Upgrade Improvements</h2><h3 id=multi-node-upgrades>Multi-Node Upgrades</h3><p>Upgrading multiple nodes used to require navigating to each node one at a time, clicking the upgrade button and then entering the node&rsquo;s name. This prevented accidental upgrades but was difficult for managing large environments. With this release users with the <code>nodes::service:node-upgrade</code> and <code>nodes::upgrade</code> permissions will have the ability to select multiple nodes from the Nodes table and then select &ldquo;Upgrade&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; menu.<figure class=centered-image><img src=multi-node-upgrade.png alt="Nodes table with two nodes selected, with the Actions dropdown showing the Upgrade option" style=display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:30%><figcaption style=text-align:center;margin-top:.5rem;font-weight:lighter>Multi-Node Upgrade Action</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=upgrade-status>Upgrade Status</h3><p>Starting with the node release dated <code>1.5.20220412-1238</code> nodes began reporting their upgrade status (In Process, Complete, Failed) to the Trustgrid cloud.

This permission was automatically added to all <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/user-management/policies/#trustgrid-managed-policy-descriptions>built-in Trustgrid Managed policies</a>, but any custom defined policies that are intended to be used on their own will need to add this permission if management portal access is desired.<figure class=centered-image><img src=portal-access.png alt="Filtered list of permissions showing Portal section with portal::access allowed" style=display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:30%><figcaption style=text-align:center;margin-top:.5rem;font-weight:lighter>Portal Access Permission</figcaption></figure><div class="alert alert-warning" role=alert>The <code>portal::access</code> must be applied with Resource scope of <code>*</code> to be effective.

We’ve now moved most of this information to a new panel dedicated for this purpose.</p><p>Hovering over the Data Plane status indicator next to the node name still includes basic details about the number of gateways known and connected. And it includes a link to the new panel for more detail:</p><p><img src=data-plane-hover.png alt="Data Plane Hover"></p><p>Clicking that link or just selecting the Data Plane panel from the left navigation bar will bring you to a new page showing much of the same detail as the <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/release-notes/cloud/archive/2021/december/>previous pop-up table</a>.</p><h3 id=data-plane-historical-stats>Data Plane Historical Stats</h3><p>You can now load historical latency data about a connection between this node and a connected gateway. Simply select the gateway from the table by clicking it, choose a start and end time and click <code>Load</code>.</p><p><img src=data-plane-view.png alt="Data Plane View"></p><h2 id=portal-tool-improvements>Portal Tool Improvements</h2><h3 id=tool-setting-history>Tool Setting History</h3><p>A common pain point when using the tools within the Trustgrid Portal was that if you had to rerun a tool you had to reenter the values into the prompt. With this release Trustgrid is introducing an execution history that will make rerunning a tool much simpler for users.</p><p>As an example, if I run the Interface <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/remote-tools/tcp-port-test/>TCP Port Test</a> tool for the first time, the target IP and port will be the defaults 192.168.1.1 and port 80</p><p><img src=tcp-port-test.png alt="TCP Port Test"></p><p>If I change these to a new IP and port and run (e.g. 172.16.22.199 and port 22) and run the tool. The next time I run the tool these settings will be populated automatically.</p><p><img src=tcp-port-test-2.png alt="TCP Port Test"></p><p>Additionally, I can click the History tab on the right to see the last few execution settings. I simply need to click apply to rerun one of the configurations listed.</p><p><img src=history.png alt=History></p><h3 id=mtr-tool>MTR Tool</h3><p>MTR (or my trace route) is an alternative to the traditional traceroute tool that expands on the data gathered and reported in a number of ways. It can be run interactively to run continuously until stopped, gather additional statistics, report multiple paths more clearly and more. While this tool has been available from within the Terminal for some time, Trustgrid has now made this accessible directly from the portal user interface.</p><blockquote><p>To use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (<code>1.5.20220215-1159</code>) or newer</p></blockquote><p>To run the tool, navigate to the Network → Interfaces section of a node and select the desired interface. Then click the MTR button.</p><p><img src=mtr-button.png alt="MTR Button"></p><p>The default settings are to target the local loopback interface IP (<code>127.0.0.1</code>) and run 10 times (<code>-c 10</code>).</p><p><img src=mtr-modal.png alt="MTR Modal"></p><p>Change the target to the desired IP or host name and update the options. Some useful options include:</p><ul><li><p><code>-T</code> to use TCP instead of ICMP and can be combined with <code>-P XXXX</code> to target a specific known listening port. This can be useful when targeting a Trustgrid gateway from and edge node. (e.g. <code>-T -P 8443</code>)</p></li><li><p><code>-w</code> runs MTR in wide screen reporting mode. You will not see output on the screen until the <code>-c</code> count has completed but the output will persist, unlike when run interactively where it is cleared from the screen at completion.</p></li></ul><p>See the <a href=https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/mtr.8.html>mtr man page</a> for additional options.</p><h3 id=interface-flows-tool>Interface Flows Tool</h3><p>Under the Network → Interface section you will see a new “Flows” tool listed</p><p><img src=flows-button.png alt="Flows Button"></p><blockquote><p>To use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (<code>1.5.20220215-1159</code>) or newer</p></blockquote><p>This tool provides information about flows traversing an interface, similar to who the VPN “View Virtual Translations Table” tool shows flows traversing the VPN.</p><p>Launching the tool you have a number of options to filter the results. Or you can run without filters to return all flows.</p><p><img src=flows-modal.png alt="Flows Filter Options"></p><p>The resulting table lists the flow found on the interface. This can be sorted by column.</p><p><img src=terminate-flow.png alt="Flows Table"></p><p>Additionally, any active flow can be Terminated (disconnected) from within the tool. You will be prompted to confirm.</p><p><img src=terminate-flow-confirm.png alt="Terminate Confirmation"></p><h2 id=network-interface-improvements>Network Interface Improvements</h2><h3 id=interface-speed-and-duplex>Interface Speed and Duplex</h3><p>The Trustgrid portal now displays the negotiated speed and duplex values:</p><p><img src=eth0.png alt="Interface Speed"></p><p>And it now allows you to change from the default Auto negotiation setting to a manual setting. This is frequently necessary when the connected port is hard set to a speed and duplex value, which breaks auto negotiation.</p><p><img src=speed.png alt="Interface Speed"></p><h2 id=alert-improvements>Alert Improvements</h2><h3 id=alert-suppression-window-events>Alert Suppression Window Events</h3><p>An Alert Suppression Window prevents the Trustgrid system from sending notification to alarm channels for a scheduled period of time. This is useful for preventing noisy alerts during planned maintenance. Historically, correlating events to this time period required remembering when the maintenance occurred.</p><p>After the suppression window is closed, either by cancelling or allowing it to expire, two events are created. One for the scheduled start:</p><p><img src=alarm-suppression.png alt="Alarm Suppression Begin"></p><p>And another for the actual end time:</p><p><img src=alarm-suppression-end.png alt="Alarm Suppression End"></p><p>These events are viewable at both the node and organization level to make it easy to correlate events to the maintenance window.</p><h3 id=override-domain-level-threshold-alerts>Override Domain Level Threshold Alerts</h3><p>Threshold alerts, such as CPU % or latency, can be configured to apply to all nodes within a domain. But sometimes it is necessary for a specific node to have different thresholds defined. With this release, the domain thresholds can be overridden.</p><p>If you navigate to the Alerts panel of a node, you will see a section at the bottom titled Global Alerts. It will list all threshold alerts defined at the higher, domain level. Click the Override button to set a node specific value.</p><p><img src=threshold-override.png alt=Override></p><p>Define a new threshold value or duration</p><p><img src=threshold.png alt="Threshold Configuration"></p><p>After you click <code>Save</code>, the value will have a yellow square to indicate it is an override.</p><p><img src=overridden-threshold.png alt="Threshold Override"></p><h3 id=threshold-alerts-included-data-points>Threshold Alerts Included Data Points</h3><p>Previously it wasn’t always clear why a threshold alert, such as an alarm regarding latency, exceeded the configured threshold. Even if you connected immediate to the device and checked the latency might have returned to normal.</p><p>Now the JSON payload sent to alarm <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/alarms/channels/>channels</a> (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.) can include the data points used to calculate the average that exceeded the threshold. This is in a new section called <code>details</code> and the values are in pairs of the timestamp <code>t</code> (unix time) and value <code>v</code> (in milliseconds in the example below).</p><div class="td-card card"><div class="card-header bg-white">Alert Payload</div><div class="card-body code p-l0 m-0"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-JSON data-lang=JSON><span style=display:flex><span>

With this release we’ve added some tools to this panel. The new Ping and Test Performance tools are linked in the far right column of each gateway’s row.</p><img src=ping-test-performance.png width=400px><h3 id=gateway-ping>Gateway Ping</h3><img src=gateway-ping-modal.png width=400px><p>The gateway ping tool will launch a ping inside the data plane tunnel between the node and the gateway, similar to ICMP ping. This can provide a more realtime view of latency between node and gateway compared to the RTT column (only loaded on refresh) and the historical data which provides a minute by minute view.</p><p><img src=ping-output.png alt="Ping Output"></p><h3 id=gateway-performance-tool>Gateway Performance Tool</h3><p>The gateway performance tool attempts to estimate the available upload bandwidth between a node and gateway.</p><img src=gateway-performance-modal.png width=400px><p>By default this tool will attempt to send 10MB of data to the destination device. This then used to calculate the available bandwidth. Sending more data provides a more accurate estimate but be aware that other devices using the same internet circuit may experience degraded performance while the test is running.</p><p><img src=performance-output.png alt="Gateway Performance Output"></p><p>The periods are posted for about every 1MB of data sent.

This made it easier to see if other users had outstanding changes that might be in conflict. However, it wasn’t clear if the other user just made that change or if it had been left accidentally. With this release we’ve added a timestamp that shows when the user saved the change.</p><p><img src=modified-route.png alt="Change Example"></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-39f41496bb3a7ec6dd0f594b12f18752>5.1.3 - May</h1><h2 id=trustgrid-permissions-restructuring>Trustgrid Permissions Restructuring</h2><p>Trustgrid’s portal and API have used Role based permissions to manage access within the Trustgrid system. As Trustgrid has expanded our feature set, adding features like containers, and our user base have grown the predefined role structure has become a poor fit. Many times these new features required Trustgrid Support to grant access to users. Additionally, what each role could and could not do was opaque to customers.</p><p>With this release will be migrating to a <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/user-management/policies/>policy-based</a> approach that will allow customers to independently tailor permissions to meet their own use cases.

As we began supporting additional services, such as Remote Access applications, more flexibility was needed.</p><h2 id=openid-support>OpenID Support</h2><p>OpenID is a newer standard for managing communication between an application and an Identity Provider (IdP). It offers additional functionality compared to SAML including the ability to simplify integration.</p><p>At this point, Trustgrid supports simplified integration with Google G Suite and Microsoft AzureAD which includes the ability to synchronize groups and group members. Trustgrid will expand this functionality to other IdPs in the future but for now, other OpenID compatible IdPs can be integrated using a more generic OpenID setup process.</p><h2 id=saml-self-service>SAML Self-Service</h2><p>Trustgrid will continue to support SAML integration. Previously the setup process required the Trustgrid Support Team to complete the configuration, but now this is available to Administrators.</p><h2 id=add-users-instead-of-inviting-them>Add Users Instead of Inviting Them</h2><p><strong>Previously</strong>, adding new users to the Trustgrid portal was a bit clunky when using the SAML integration. To add a user you would:</p><ol><li><p>Invite the user. This would generate an email which the user didn’t really need.</p></li><li><p>The user would then need to successfully authenticate via the configured IdP.</p></li><li><p>You could then adjust the user&rsquo;s role to reflect the appropriate permissions.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Now</strong>, when an IdP is configured there is a simplified process:</p><ol><li><p>From the User Management panel click “Add User”</p></li><li><p>From a single prompt, you can enter the user’s email address (matching what is configured in the Identify Provider), set their Role, and select the correct Identity Provider (if there is more than one).</p><p><img src=add-user-modal.png alt="Add User Modal"></p></li></ol><p>The option to Invite Users is still available under Actions if you need to create users in the Trustgrid native IdP.</p><h2 id=domain-improvements>Domain Improvements</h2><p>In addition to the changes outlined below, it is worth noting that Domains have been moved under the Management section of the navigation bar.</p><h3 id=review-changes>Review Changes</h3><p>Trustgrid Domains encompass configuration settings that impact many nodes and clusters, such as Virtual Network Routes. The impacts of changes here can have a wide effect and it is not uncommon for multiple members of a team to be working in this context at the same time without knowing it.</p><p>To address this Trustgrid has updated the user interface to reduce the risk of improper or conflicting changes. After a change is made within a domain it is not immediately applied.</p><ol><li><p>Instead, a warning icon will be added to the Review Changes panel. Navigating to this panel will display all changes that are waiting to be applied.</p></li><li><p>The changes will include the user making the change. If more than one user has made changes they can confirm with that user if they are ready for that change to go into effect.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, if they determine one of the changes should not be applied it can be removed by clicking the red X. Be aware that if this is done the change would have to be recreated and reviewed to add later.</p></li><li><p>Once the user has confirmed the changes look correct they can click Apply Changes. You will be prompted to confirm and then the changes will be pushed out to nodes in the domain.</p></li></ol><p><img src=review-changes.png alt="Review Changes Screen"></p><h3 id=improved-virtual-network-routes-table>Improved Virtual Network Routes Table</h3><p>The Virtual Network Routes table has been significantly reworked in this release.</p><p>The biggest improvement is in the Destination selection method. The old interface required selecting from a long list of all nodes and clusters in the domains which became unmanageable as the number of these increased. Additionally, there was no distinguishing between nodes and clusters beyond the name.</p><p>Now when the Destination field is selected you are given a list (typeahead filtered) that now has a prefix of Cluster or Node to clearly identify the destination type.</p><p>Additionally, the Save and Add Routes buttons have been moved to the top of the table to reduce the need to scroll down as you work.</p><h3 id=no-nat-virtual-networks>No-NAT Virtual Networks</h3><p>Making Network Address Translation (NAT) easier to manage and scale has been a primary use case for Trustgrid. However, there are some situations where altering the IP addresses is unnecessary and even undesirable.</p><p>To address this we have added the ability to create a Virtual Network that will perform no address translation by default. This should greatly increase the ease of configuring such networks.</p><p>When adding a new Virtual Network set the “No NAT Mode” to Yes. For a Network CIDR just enter 0.0.0.0/0, this field will be made optional in a later release.</p><p><img src=add-network-modal.png alt="Add Network Modal"></p><p>After creation, you will see that NO-NAT Mode is enabled in the table.</p><p><img src=networks-table.png alt="Networks Table"></p><p>Whenever this network is attached to a Node or Cluster interface you will see a notice like the below.</p><p><img src=no-nat-notice.png alt="No NAT Notice"></p><h2 id=vpn-improvements>VPN Improvements</h2><p>The VPN interface in the portal has been reworked in ways we hope will simplify the experience when configuring and managing.</p><h3 id=feature-navigation-panels>Feature Navigation Panels</h3><p>The legacy VPN page frequently required significant scrolling to get to the most relevant section. The new interface breaks these sections into multiple panels.</p><p>Since Address Translation is the most commonly used section it is automatically selected when you navigate into the VPN context.</p><h3 id=improved-multiple-virtual-network-support>Improved Multiple Virtual Network Support</h3><p>Trustgrid has supported Nodes and Clusters being attached to multiple Virtual Networks but the user experience interacting with them was cumbersome. For example, in a number of places, you had to select from a list of all the available virtual networks, even if they weren’t attached. This experience has been greatly improved.</p><h3 id=vpn-virtual-networks-table>VPN Virtual Networks Table</h3><p>If the Node or Cluster is already attached to a single Virtual Network this will be selected automatically when you select the VPN navigation link. However, if you have multiple networks you will be presented with a table of only the attached Virtual Networks.</p><p><img src=virtual-networks-table.png alt="Virtual Networks Table"></p><p>The Actions dropdown of this table will enable you to Attach additional Virtual Networks or Detach the current Virtual Networks.</p><h3 id=overview-virtual-network-graph>Overview Virtual Network Graph</h3><p>Previously the Overview Virtual Network graph listed all Virtual Networks within a domain. Now it will only show attached networks.</p><h2 id=vpn-toolbar>VPN Toolbar</h2><p>Once you have navigated to the VPN context of a node and selected a Virtual Network you will see a bar like the below at the top of the page. The bar provides important data about the Virtual Network including the node’s Virtual Management IP (and the ability to edit it).</p><p><img src=vpn-toolbar.png alt="VPN Toolbar"></p><p>Clicking the Tools button on the right of the bar brings up a menu of both Virtual Network and Interface tools. Users no longer have to switch between tabs to access these different toolsets.</p><p><img src=vpn-tools.png alt="VPN Tools"></p><h2 id=new-virtual-translation-table-interface>New Virtual Translation Table Interface</h2><p>The View Virtual Translation Table shows active NATs similar to a <code>show connections</code> command from legacy solutions. Previously running this tool produced raw console output that could be challenging to work with when there were large numbers of active connections.</p><p>The new version of the tools creates a paginated table that is easily searchable and can be refreshed without needing to return to the Tools section.</p><p><img src=virtual-nats-table.png alt="Virtual NATs Table"></p><h2 id=proxyarp-option-for-outside-nats>ProxyARP Option for Outside NATs</h2><p>Previously the Trustgrid node would ARP on the local network for any IP contained in the Local CIDR of an outside NAT. For example, if your Outside NAT Local CIDR was for 192.168.1.0/24, the node would respond to ARP requests for any IP in that network (192.168.1.1 - .254).</p><p>This is still the default behavior, but there is now an option to disable this functionality when configuring Outside NATs.</p><p><img src=proxy-arp-option.png alt="Proxy ARP Option"></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8559d37c0b836792e1fe4efc7b2e2568>5.2.2 - August</h1><h2 id=tag-improvements>Tag Improvements</h2><p>Two major improvements regarding tags.</p><h3 id=cluster-members-inherit-tags>Cluster Members Inherit Tags</h3><p>Previously you had to set tags at the node and cluster level which required a lot of duplicate effort.

This should allow integration with additional systems beyond the built-in channels Trustgrid supports.</p><p>To utilize either edit an existing channel or create a new one and populate the Generic Webhook section.</p><p><img src=generic-webhook.png alt="Generic Webhook"></p><h2 id=provisioning-improvements>Provisioning Improvements</h2><p>There have been several changes to the Provisioning (formerly Orders) section of the Portal including:</p><ul><li>Due Dates for Orders</li><li>Support for specific device models (as opposed to just hardware vs virtual)</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-341d62c1a35050f7f6585131a084371c>5.2.3 - September</h1><h2 id=container--improvements>Container Improvements</h2><p>Trustgrid has greatly enhanced the container features we support and this release makes these features available to all users.</p><h3 id=container-management>Container Management</h3><p>You can now stop and start individual containers running as a service from within the portal.</p><p><img src=stop-start-buttons.png alt="Stop Start Buttons"></p><h3 id=container-volumes-and-mounts>Container Volumes and Mounts</h3><p>Containers on Trustgrid now support creating persistent volumes and mounting them within the container. These volumes can even be encrypted using Trustgrid managed, software-based encryption.</p><h3 id=container-privileges>Container Privileges</h3><p>It is now possible to run containers as a privileged user or specify the user/group the container should execute as. Additionally, you can add or drop Linux capabilities that the container has enabled on execution.</p><h3 id=import-container-configuration>Import Container Configuration</h3><p>Container configurations can end up complex. Recreating on many nodes is tedious and error prone. Trustgrid now supports importing the configuration from an existing node or cluster that has the container defined as desired.</p><h2 id=interactive-tools-improvements>Interactive Tools Improvements</h2><h3 id=terminate-running-tools-without-closing-window>Terminate Running Tools without Closing Window</h3><p>Interactive tools such as Terminal and Sniff Traffic now support terminating the session without closing the window. This can be useful in situations, such as if sniffing traffic on a very active node, where you want to be able to stop the tool but still be able to analyze the output.</p><h3 id=traffic-capture-tool-improvements>Traffic Capture Tool Improvements</h3><p>The Traffic Capture tool now displays the settings used while running. This includes the interface and filter.</p><p><img src=capture-settings.png alt="Capture Settings"></p><h2 id=provisioning-and-order-management-improvements>Provisioning and Order Management Improvements</h2><p>The Provisioning section of the Trustgrid portal has been extensively overhauled to improve the order management experience and make future improvements easier.</p><h3 id=new-look>New Look</h3><p>The first change you’ll notice is that clicking Provisioning opens a new tab. The orders table now makes it easier to search and filter the results.</p><p>The individual order screen is now a single page view to reduce the need to switch between tabs. And orders now support attaching files such as legacy device configurations or diagrams that might be useful for configuring the new devices.</p><h3 id=order-notifications>Order Notifications</h3><p>You can now configure <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/alarms/alarm-filters/>Alarm Filters</a> for four new order based events:</p><ul><li>Order Created</li><li>Order Commented</li><li>Order Status Change</li><li>Order Customer Update</li></ul><p>These events can then be sent to existing or newly defined <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/alarms/channels/>channels</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-32e4821014579466d4da57e5e4f411e7>5.2.4 - December</h1><h2 id=data-plane-status-table>Data Plane Status Table</h2><p>Previously Trustgrid had a visual indicator on the Node detail page to show the Data Plane health of a node, but it only showed the state as <code>Connected</code>, <code>Degraded</code> or <code>Disconnected</code>. While connected and disconnected were clear, there was little information on why the status was Degraded.</p><p>With this release hovering over the Data Plane status icon will bring up a pop-up screen showing all the peers and and their connection status. Additionally, if the peer is connected it will show:</p><ul><li>The public IP of the peer</li><li>The mode used to connect to with the peer (TLS or UDP)</li><li>The route trip time (RTT) between the devices when the tool was last run.</li></ul><p>This data can be searched and refreshed. In a future release we will make historical RTT time viewable for each peer.</p><p><img src=data-plane-hover.png alt="Data Plane Status"></p><h2 id=flow-log-improvements>Flow Log Improvements</h2><p>Flow logs provide valuable metadata about traffic across Trustgrid networks but our search had performance and reliability issues that made it difficult to use. With this release we’ve rearchitected how search these logs to allow for a significant performance improvement.</p><h2 id=improved-ip-geolocation-data>Improved IP Geolocation Data</h2><p>Trustgrid has changed our public IP geolocation data providers to improve the accuracy of the information we use to place nodes on our Network Maps. This new provider will also allow us to present additional information such as ISP and ASN in the future, which could be handy for identifying when multiple devices from the same ISP or ASN start having issues.</p><h2 id=custom-portal-roles>Custom Portal Roles</h2><p>Trustgrid is working on moving our permission structure beyond the four default roles (Monitor, Operator, Node-Administrator and Administrator) to allow customers to tailor roles to just the permissions their users need. For example, you could allow a user Monitor (read-only) permissions to most of the Trustgrid environment but grant them the ability to stop and start containers.</p><p>Currently this requires working with Trustgrid Support to define these new roles but once defined they can be assigned by Node Administrators and Administrators.</p><h2 id=other-improvements>Other Improvements</h2><ul><li>You can now search the Nodes table for Management IPs and Device types</li><li>Fixed a broken link in the new user invite email for customers without IDP integration</li></ul></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=LinkedIn aria-label=LinkedIn><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/trustgrid/ aria-label=LinkedIn><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/trustgrid aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2023 Trustgrid All Rights Reserved</small>
