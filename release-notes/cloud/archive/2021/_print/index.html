As we began supporting additional services, such as Remote Access applications, more flexibility was needed.</p><h2 id=openid-support>OpenID Support</h2><p>OpenID is a newer standard for managing communication between an application and an Identity Provider (IdP). It offers additional functionality compared to SAML including the ability to simplify integration.</p><p>At this point, Trustgrid supports simplified integration with Google G Suite and Microsoft AzureAD which includes the ability to synchronize groups and group members. Trustgrid will expand this functionality to other IdPs in the future but for now, other OpenID compatible IdPs can be integrated using a more generic OpenID setup process.</p><h2 id=saml-self-service>SAML Self-Service</h2><p>Trustgrid will continue to support SAML integration. Previously the setup process required the Trustgrid Support Team to complete the configuration, but now this is available to Administrators.</p><h2 id=add-users-instead-of-inviting-them>Add Users Instead of Inviting Them</h2><p><strong>Previously</strong>, adding new users to the Trustgrid portal was a bit clunky when using the SAML integration. To add a user you would:</p><ol><li><p>Invite the user. This would generate an email which the user didn’t really need.</p></li><li><p>The user would then need to successfully authenticate via the configured IdP.</p></li><li><p>You could then adjust the user&rsquo;s role to reflect the appropriate permissions.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Now</strong>, when an IdP is configured there is a simplified process:</p><ol><li><p>From the User Management panel click “Add User”</p></li><li><p>From a single prompt, you can enter the user’s email address (matching what is configured in the Identify Provider), set their Role, and select the correct Identity Provider (if there is more than one).</p><p><img src=add-user-modal.png alt="Add User Modal"></p></li></ol><p>The option to Invite Users is still available under Actions if you need to create users in the Trustgrid native IdP.</p><h2 id=domain-improvements>Domain Improvements</h2><p>In addition to the changes outlined below, it is worth noting that Domains have been moved under the Management section of the navigation bar.</p><h3 id=review-changes>Review Changes</h3><p>Trustgrid Domains encompass configuration settings that impact many nodes and clusters, such as Virtual Network Routes. The impacts of changes here can have a wide effect and it is not uncommon for multiple members of a team to be working in this context at the same time without knowing it.</p><p>To address this Trustgrid has updated the user interface to reduce the risk of improper or conflicting changes. After a change is made within a domain it is not immediately applied.</p><ol><li><p>Instead, a warning icon will be added to the Review Changes panel. Navigating to this panel will display all changes that are waiting to be applied.</p></li><li><p>The changes will include the user making the change. If more than one user has made changes they can confirm with that user if they are ready for that change to go into effect.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, if they determine one of the changes should not be applied it can be removed by clicking the red X. Be aware that if this is done the change would have to be recreated and reviewed to add later.</p></li><li><p>Once the user has confirmed the changes look correct they can click Apply Changes. You will be prompted to confirm and then the changes will be pushed out to nodes in the domain.</p></li></ol><p><img src=review-changes.png alt="Review Changes Screen"></p><h3 id=improved-virtual-network-routes-table>Improved Virtual Network Routes Table</h3><p>The Virtual Network Routes table has been significantly reworked in this release.</p><p>The biggest improvement is in the Destination selection method. The old interface required selecting from a long list of all nodes and clusters in the domains which became unmanageable as the number of these increased. Additionally, there was no distinguishing between nodes and clusters beyond the name.</p><p>Now when the Destination field is selected you are given a list (typeahead filtered) that now has a prefix of Cluster or Node to clearly identify the destination type.</p><p>Additionally, the Save and Add Routes buttons have been moved to the top of the table to reduce the need to scroll down as you work.</p><h3 id=no-nat-virtual-networks>No-NAT Virtual Networks</h3><p>Making Network Address Translation (NAT) easier to manage and scale has been a primary use case for Trustgrid. However, there are some situations where altering the IP addresses is unnecessary and even undesirable.</p><p>To address this we have added the ability to create a Virtual Network that will perform no address translation by default. This should greatly increase the ease of configuring such networks.</p><p>When adding a new Virtual Network set the “No NAT Mode” to Yes. For a Network CIDR just enter 0.0.0.0/0, this field will be made optional in a later release.</p><p><img src=add-network-modal.png alt="Add Network Modal"></p><p>After creation, you will see that NO-NAT Mode is enabled in the table.</p><p><img src=networks-table.png alt="Networks Table"></p><p>Whenever this network is attached to a Node or Cluster interface you will see a notice like the below.</p><p><img src=no-nat-notice.png alt="No NAT Notice"></p><h2 id=vpn-improvements>VPN Improvements</h2><p>The VPN interface in the portal has been reworked in ways we hope will simplify the experience when configuring and managing.</p><h3 id=feature-navigation-panels>Feature Navigation Panels</h3><p>The legacy VPN page frequently required significant scrolling to get to the most relevant section. The new interface breaks these sections into multiple panels.</p><p>Since Address Translation is the most commonly used section it is automatically selected when you navigate into the VPN context.</p><h3 id=improved-multiple-virtual-network-support>Improved Multiple Virtual Network Support</h3><p>Trustgrid has supported Nodes and Clusters being attached to multiple Virtual Networks but the user experience interacting with them was cumbersome. For example, in a number of places, you had to select from a list of all the available virtual networks, even if they weren’t attached. This experience has been greatly improved.</p><h3 id=vpn-virtual-networks-table>VPN Virtual Networks Table</h3><p>If the Node or Cluster is already attached to a single Virtual Network this will be selected automatically when you select the VPN navigation link. However, if you have multiple networks you will be presented with a table of only the attached Virtual Networks.</p><p><img src=virtual-networks-table.png alt="Virtual Networks Table"></p><p>The Actions dropdown of this table will enable you to Attach additional Virtual Networks or Detach the current Virtual Networks.</p><h3 id=overview-virtual-network-graph>Overview Virtual Network Graph</h3><p>Previously the Overview Virtual Network graph listed all Virtual Networks within a domain. Now it will only show attached networks.</p><h2 id=vpn-toolbar>VPN Toolbar</h2><p>Once you have navigated to the VPN context of a node and selected a Virtual Network you will see a bar like the below at the top of the page. The bar provides important data about the Virtual Network including the node’s Virtual Management IP (and the ability to edit it).</p><p><img src=vpn-toolbar.png alt="VPN Toolbar"></p><p>Clicking the Tools button on the right of the bar brings up a menu of both Virtual Network and Interface tools. Users no longer have to switch between tabs to access these different toolsets.</p><p><img src=vpn-tools.png alt="VPN Tools"></p><h2 id=new-virtual-translation-table-interface>New Virtual Translation Table Interface</h2><p>The View Virtual Translation Table shows active NATs similar to a <code>show connections</code> command from legacy solutions. Previously running this tool produced raw console output that could be challenging to work with when there were large numbers of active connections.</p><p>The new version of the tools creates a paginated table that is easily searchable and can be refreshed without needing to return to the Tools section.</p><p><img src=virtual-nats-table.png alt="Virtual NATs Table"></p><h2 id=proxyarp-option-for-outside-nats>ProxyARP Option for Outside NATs</h2><p>Previously the Trustgrid node would ARP on the local network for any IP contained in the Local CIDR of an outside NAT. For example, if your Outside NAT Local CIDR was for 192.168.1.0/24, the node would respond to ARP requests for any IP in that network (192.168.1.1 - .254).</p><p>This is still the default behavior, but there is now an option to disable this functionality when configuring Outside NATs.</p><p><img src=proxy-arp-option.png alt="Proxy ARP Option"></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8559d37c0b836792e1fe4efc7b2e2568>2 - August</h1><h2 id=tag-improvements>Tag Improvements</h2><p>Two major improvements regarding tags.</p><h3 id=cluster-members-inherit-tags>Cluster Members Inherit Tags</h3><p>Previously you had to set tags at the node and cluster level which required a lot of duplicate effort. Now when you configure tags at the cluster level the member nodes inherit this tag.</p><h3 id=tags-searchable-in-the-nodes-table>Tags Searchable in the Nodes Table</h3><p>With this release if you add a tag as a column to the nodes table, you can then search the table for matching values.</p><h2 id=nodes-table-improvements>Nodes Table Improvements</h2><p>Two new columns can be added to the nodes table:</p><h3 id=virtual-management-ip-column>Virtual Management IP Column</h3><p>You can now see from the table the virtual management IP assigned to each node. If you have multiple virtual networks you will have the option to select each network as a column. These columns have the prefix <code>MGMT IP:</code>.</p><p><img src=available-columns.png alt="Available Columns"></p><h3 id=device-type-column>Device Type Column</h3><p>You can now see what type of device, physical or virtual, is running the node software.</p><h2 id=generic-webhook-support-as-an-alert-channel>Generic Webhook Support as an Alert Channel</h2><p>This version adds the ability to publish alerts to a channel utilizing a generic webhook. This should allow integration with additional systems beyond the built-in channels Trustgrid supports.</p><p>To utilize either edit an existing channel or create a new one and populate the Generic Webhook section.</p><p><img src=generic-webhook.png alt="Generic Webhook"></p><h2 id=provisioning-improvements>Provisioning Improvements</h2><p>There have been several changes to the Provisioning (formerly Orders) section of the Portal including:</p><ul><li>Due Dates for Orders</li><li>Support for specific device models (as opposed to just hardware vs virtual)</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-341d62c1a35050f7f6585131a084371c>3 - September</h1><h2 id=container--improvements>Container Improvements</h2><p>Trustgrid has greatly enhanced the container features we support and this release makes these features available to all users.</p><h3 id=container-management>Container Management</h3><p>You can now stop and start individual containers running as a service from within the portal.</p><p><img src=stop-start-buttons.png alt="Stop Start Buttons"></p><h3 id=container-volumes-and-mounts>Container Volumes and Mounts</h3><p>Containers on Trustgrid now support creating persistent volumes and mounting them within the container. These volumes can even be encrypted using Trustgrid managed, software-based encryption.</p><h3 id=container-privileges>Container Privileges</h3><p>It is now possible to run containers as a privileged user or specify the user/group the container should execute as. Additionally, you can add or drop Linux capabilities that the container has enabled on execution.</p><h3 id=import-container-configuration>Import Container Configuration</h3><p>Container configurations can end up complex. Recreating on many nodes is tedious and error prone. Trustgrid now supports importing the configuration from an existing node or cluster that has the container defined as desired.</p><h2 id=interactive-tools-improvements>Interactive Tools Improvements</h2><h3 id=terminate-running-tools-without-closing-window>Terminate Running Tools without Closing Window</h3><p>Interactive tools such as Terminal and Sniff Traffic now support terminating the session without closing the window. This can be useful in situations, such as if sniffing traffic on a very active node, where you want to be able to stop the tool but still be able to analyze the output.</p><h3 id=traffic-capture-tool-improvements>Traffic Capture Tool Improvements</h3><p>The Traffic Capture tool now displays the settings used while running. This includes the interface and filter.</p><p><img src=capture-settings.png alt="Capture Settings"></p><h2 id=provisioning-and-order-management-improvements>Provisioning and Order Management Improvements</h2><p>The Provisioning section of the Trustgrid portal has been extensively overhauled to improve the order management experience and make future improvements easier.</p><h3 id=new-look>New Look</h3><p>The first change you’ll notice is that clicking Provisioning opens a new tab. The orders table now makes it easier to search and filter the results.</p><p>The individual order screen is now a single page view to reduce the need to switch between tabs. And orders now support attaching files such as legacy device configurations or diagrams that might be useful for configuring the new devices.</p><h3 id=order-notifications>Order Notifications</h3><p>You can now configure <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/alarms/alarm-filters/>Alarm Filters</a> for four new order based events:</p><ul><li>Order Created</li><li>Order Commented</li><li>Order Status Change</li><li>Order Customer Update</li></ul><p>These events can then be sent to existing or newly defined <a href=https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/alarms/channels/>channels</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-32e4821014579466d4da57e5e4f411e7>4 - December</h1><h2 id=data-plane-status-table>Data Plane Status Table</h2><p>Previously Trustgrid had a visual indicator on the Node detail page to show the Data Plane health of a node, but it only showed the state as <code>Connected</code>, <code>Degraded</code> or <code>Disconnected</code>. While connected and disconnected were clear, there was little information on why the status was Degraded.</p><p>With this release hovering over the Data Plane status icon will bring up a pop-up screen showing all the peers and and their connection status. Additionally, if the peer is connected it will show:</p><ul><li>The public IP of the peer</li><li>The mode used to connect to with the peer (TLS or UDP)</li><li>The route trip time (RTT) between the devices when the tool was last run.</li></ul><p>This data can be searched and refreshed. In a future release we will make historical RTT time viewable for each peer.</p><p><img src=data-plane-hover.png alt="Data Plane Status"></p><h2 id=flow-log-improvements>Flow Log Improvements</h2><p>Flow logs provide valuable metadata about traffic across Trustgrid networks but our search had performance and reliability issues that made it difficult to use. With this release we’ve rearchitected how search these logs to allow for a significant performance improvement.</p><h2 id=improved-ip-geolocation-data>Improved IP Geolocation Data</h2><p>Trustgrid has changed our public IP geolocation data providers to improve the accuracy of the information we use to place nodes on our Network Maps. This new provider will also allow us to present additional information such as ISP and ASN in the future, which could be handy for identifying when multiple devices from the same ISP or ASN start having issues.</p><h2 id=custom-portal-roles>Custom Portal Roles</h2><p>Trustgrid is working on moving our permission structure beyond the four default roles (Monitor, Operator, Node-Administrator and Administrator) to allow customers to tailor roles to just the permissions their users need. For example, you could allow a user Monitor (read-only) permissions to most of the Trustgrid environment but grant them the ability to stop and start containers.</p><p>Currently this requires working with Trustgrid Support to define these new roles but once defined they can be assigned by Node Administrators and Administrators.</p><h2 id=other-improvements>Other Improvements</h2><ul><li>You can now search the Nodes table for Management IPs and Device types</li><li>Fixed a broken link in the new user invite email for customers without IDP integration</li></ul></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=LinkedIn aria-label=LinkedIn><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/trustgrid/ aria-label=LinkedIn><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/trustgrid aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2023 Trustgrid All Rights Reserved</small>
