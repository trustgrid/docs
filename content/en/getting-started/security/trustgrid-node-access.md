By default, Trustgrid support has access to all nodes via the Control Plane, subject to Trustgrid policies and procedures. Trustgrid customers may opt to disallow Trustgrid support access to their nodes by [disabling remote support]({{<relref "/docs/support#remote-support">}}). Disabling support access does not interfere with automated management features such as patching, updating, logging, or authentication.

Changes to the support flag are audited.
