Trustgrid is an edge platform that provides [secure]({{<relref "./security">}}), reliable, and high-performance [connectivity]({{<relref "./networking">}}) between distributed systems and applications. The platform is designed to simplify networking for distributed enterprises by providing a software-defined network (SDN) that operates as a virtual overlay on top of existing networks, enabling organizations to build and manage private virtual networks with ease.

With Trustgrid you can:
- Deploy nodes worldwide to establish private network connectivity between sites, data centers, and public clouds
- Provide simplified, secured, and compliance-friendly edge connectivity for your remote sites, customers, vendors, or partners **requiring only outbound connectivity**
- Manage fleets of edge devices from a centralized cloud-based console for configuration, monitoring, updates, and more
- Gain visibility into traffic across your network with integrated flow logs and live troubleshooting tools
