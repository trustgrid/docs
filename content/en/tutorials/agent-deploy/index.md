## Supported Operating Systems

### Linux 

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9

### Container
The Trustgrid agent can be deployed as a container on Linux systems. This provides an isolated environment for the agent without requiring a full operating system instance. 

Trustgrid provides a Docker image that contains the agent pre-configured and optimized to run in Docker or similar container hosting environments like Kubernetes.

## Agent Installation
Installation instructions are also shown in the portal after [adding an agent]({{<ref "/tutorials/agent-deploy/_index.md#adding-agents">}}).

The Trustgrid agent is provided as a package in a custom repository hosted by Trustgrid. 
### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
The below commands add the Trustgrid repository and required keys to ensure trusted communication. The agent package is then installed.
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trustgrid-keyring.gpg] https://tgpkg.io/apt tg-agent-jammy main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tg-agent-jammy.list \
  curl -fsSL https://portal.trustgrid.io/packages/trustgrid-keyring.gpg \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/trustgrid-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y tg-agent
```
Then you can use the `config` command to provide the token generated by the [add agent](#add-agent) process.
```bash
tg-agent config --token <token>
```

The below instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) may also work for related distributions,  like Fedora and CentOS, but this has not been validated by Trustgrid.
