## Removal of Select All Option
As part of the [July backend library]({{<relref "/release-notes/cloud/2024-07#portal-backend-library-update">}}) a "Select All" option was introduced on tables, such as the nodes table. Trustgrid has determined this option creates risks of large changes with insufficient controls to prevent mistakes so we are removing it from all tables.
