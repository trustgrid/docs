{{<tgimg src="users.png" width="90%" caption="Users page">}}

The Users panel is the primary panel for managing user identities and the policies attached to them. All changes in this panel require either the [builtin-tg-acess-admin]({{<ref "/docs/user-management/policies#tg-builtin-access-admin">}}) policy or similar permissions.

## Adding or Inviting Users

Users can either be invited to the Trustgrid portal and utilize Trustgrid’s native authentication system, or be added and be authenticated by a customer configured Identity Provider (IdP).

### Inviting Users

For users that will utilize Trustgrid’s native authentication system, you will need to invite them with a valid email address.

1. Navigate to `User Management` → `Users`
1. Under `Actions` select `Invite User`
{{<tgimg src="invite.png" caption="Invite User action">}}
1. Enter the user’s valid email address and select the desired base policy (more can be attached later).
{{<tgimg src="send-invite.png" alt="Enter email and base policy">}}
1. Click `Send Invite`. You should see a confirmation that the invite was sent like the one below.
{{<tgimg src="invite-sent.png" alt="Invite sent confirmation" width="40%">}}
1. The user will receive an email with a link to the [Trustgrid Portal](https://portal.trustgrid.io) or similar. They will need to click said link.

1. Once at the Portal, the user will need to click the `Start a free trial` option. **The user must use the same email address that was invited to get access to your account**.

1. The user will be prompted for their email, name, password, and company. **The user must use the same email address that was invited to get access to your account**.  
{{<tgimg src="sign-up-2.png" caption="Enter required information and click Sign Up" width="60%">}}
1. A verification email will then be sent to the invited user's email address. They will need to click the link in the email to verify their email and complete registration.
1. After verifying their email address the user will be prompted to configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Trustgrid recommends using a one-time password MFA such as Authy or Google Authenticator.
   1. Scan the QR code with your app. 
   1. Enter the passcode and click the `Submit` button. {{<tgimg src="sign-up-4.png" width="50%" >}}
1. The user is returned to the login screen. Login with the newly created email, password, and MFA code.  You will then be redirected back to the Trustgrid portal.

### Adding Users (with Identity Providers)

If your account has an [Identity Provider (IdP)]({{<ref "/docs/idps">}}) configured as a Portal Auth Provider, you use the Add User button to create an identity for them within Trustgrid.

{{<alert color="info">}} Some IdP’s allow for users to be synchronized automatically making this step unnecessary {{</alert>}}

1. Navigate to `User Management` → `Users`
1. Click the `Add User` button {{<tgimg src="add-user.png" width="30%">}}
1. Enter in the user’s email address. **This must be the same email address the IdP sends back to Trustgrid, if unsure consult with your IdP Admin**.
1. Select your Identity Provider (if more than one)
1. Select the desired base policy. More can be attached later.
1. Click `Save`
{{<tgimg src="save-new-user.png" caption="Add User Prompt" width="40%">}}
1. The user can then navigate to the portal [authentication domain]({{<ref "/docs/idps">}}) associated with the IdP. They will be redirected to the IdP page and required to enter their username, password and MFA (if configured), then automatically sent back to the Trustgrid portal.
