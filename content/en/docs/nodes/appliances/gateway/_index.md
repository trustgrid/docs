The Gateway panels contains settings determining how the node connects to peer nodes by either acting as a server or client.  The tunnels created by these connections are the foundation for the underlay network that enables overlay services like site-to-site VPN and L4 proxy services. 
Additionally, the Diagnostics page can be of use troubleshooting connectivity issues if layer 4 connectivity has already been confirmed.
