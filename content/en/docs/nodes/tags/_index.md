A tag is a name / value pair that can be used to provide additional information about a Trustgrid resource ([nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes">}}), [clusters]({{<ref "docs/clusters" >}}), etc).
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Tags are useful when managing enterprise-scale deployments of [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}). Tags allow the user to identify quickly and easily a [node]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}) or group of [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}) with the same property. Both the name and value of the tags are set by the user. Names should provide the context and values provide the actual data. For example, to provide the address of a device you would set the name to `address`, and the value to something like `123 Main St`.

{{<alert>}}It is a best practice for Trustgrid customers to standardize on a set of tag names and appropriate values. This increases the consistency of use across your organization. When adding tags the existing tag names and associated values will be prepopulated as options.{{</alert>}}

Some common uses of tags are:

- Supporting information (production status, contact info, hours of operation, escalation)
- On-premise/edge location information (site name, address, pin code)
- Configuration (High availability, instance type, region, disaster recovery)

{{<alert color="warning">}}
Tag names and values are case-sensitive and should only consist of letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`).
