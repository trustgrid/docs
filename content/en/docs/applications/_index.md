ZTNA Applications

ZTNA Applications are managed by clicking the `Applications` link on the left nav bar.

PUT SCREENSHOT OF APPS

Trustgrid provides several ZTNA application types that allow remote access to internal resources through a continuously validated connection.

Each application has an [Access Policy](put-link-here) and a [Visibility](put-link-here) list. For a user to connect to a ZTNA application, they must (1) be permitted access by the application's Access Policy and (2) be able to see the application.

Access to an application is authenticated through an [Identity Provider](put-link-here) (IdP).
