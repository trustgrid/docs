Node audits provide records when services on a node are invoked, or when upgrades are applied. This can be helpful to see historical maintenance of a node.

Node audits can be viewed for a specific node by navigating to `Audits` under the `History` section on the node view.

Users will need `audits::read:node` permissions to view node audits.
