This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

The overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

### What is it?

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

### Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:

### Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the overview. For example:

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with a project here!
- [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code from this link to build your project!
