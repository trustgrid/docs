By default, Trustgrid support has access to all [nodes]({{< ref "docs/node" >}}) via the Control Plane, subject to Trustgrid policies and procedures. Trustgrid customers may opt to disallow Trustgrid support access to their [nodes]({{< ref "docs/node" >}}). Disabling support access does not interfere with automated management features such as patching, updating, logging, or authentication.

Changes to the support flag are audited.
