By default, Trustgrid support has access to all [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}) via the Control Plane, subject to Trustgrid policies and procedures. Trustgrid customers may opt to disallow Trustgrid support access to their [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}). Disabling support access does not interfere with automated management features such as patching, updating, logging, or authentication.

Changes to the support flag are audited.
