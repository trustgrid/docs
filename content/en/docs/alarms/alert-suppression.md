Maintenance and other planned disruptive activity can generate a large amount of alerts and notifications for no value.  The Trustgrid system allows you to define Alert Suppression windows during which no alerts are triggered.

5. From the drop down select the hour that you want the window to begin. This time will be set based off your browserâ€™s current timezone setting.   This uses the 24 hour clock (e.g. 0 = 12 am, 14 = 2pm)
