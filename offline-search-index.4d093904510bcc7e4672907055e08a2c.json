We’ve now moved most of this information to a new panel dedicated for this purpose.\nHovering over the Data Plane status indicator next to the node name still includes basic details about the number of gateways known and connected. And it includes a link to the new panel for more detail:\nClicking that link or just selecting the Data Plane panel from the left navigation bar will bring you to a new page showing much of the same detail as the previous pop-up table.\nData Plane Historical Stats You can now load historical latency data about a connection between this node and a connected gateway. Simply select the gateway from the table by clicking it, choose a start and end time and click Load.\nPortal Tool Improvements Tool Setting History A common pain point when using the tools within the Trustgrid Portal was that if you had to rerun a tool you had to reenter the values into the prompt. With this release Trustgrid is introducing an execution history that will make rerunning a tool much simpler for users.\nAs an example, if I run the Interface TCP Port Test tool for the first time, the target IP and port will be the defaults 192.168.1.1 and port 80\nIf I change these to a new IP and port and run (e.g. 172.16.22.199 and port 22) and run the tool. The next time I run the tool these settings will be populated automatically.\nAdditionally, I can click the History tab on the right to see the last few execution settings. I simply need to click apply to rerun one of the configurations listed.\nMTR Tool MTR (or my trace route) is an alternative to the traditional traceroute tool that expands on the data gathered and reported in a number of ways. It can be run interactively to run continuously until stopped, gather additional statistics, report multiple paths more clearly and more. While this tool has been available from within the Terminal for some time, Trustgrid has now made this accessible directly from the portal user interface.\nTo use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (1.5.20220215-1159) or newer\nTo run the tool, navigate to the Network → Interfaces section of a node and select the desired interface. Then click the MTR button.\nThe default settings are to target the local loopback interface IP (127.0.0.1) and run 10 times (-c 10).\nChange the target to the desired IP or host name and update the options. Some useful options include:\n-T to use TCP instead of ICMP and can be combined with -P XXXX to target a specific known listening port. This can be useful when targeting a Trustgrid gateway from and edge node. (e.g. -T -P 8443)\n-w runs MTR in wide screen reporting mode. You will not see output on the screen until the -c count has completed but the output will persist, unlike when run interactively where it is cleared from the screen at completion.\nSee the mtr man page for additional options.\nInterface Flows Tool Under the Network → Interface section you will see a new “Flows” tool listed\nTo use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (1.5.20220215-1159) or newer\nThis tool provides information about flows traversing an interface, similar to who the VPN “View Virtual Translations Table” tool shows flows traversing the VPN.\nLaunching the tool you have a number of options to filter the results. Or you can run without filters to return all flows.\nThe resulting table lists the flow found on the interface. This can be sorted by column.\nAdditionally, any active flow can be Terminated (disconnected) from within the tool. You will be prompted to confirm.\nNetwork Interface Improvements Interface Speed and Duplex The Trustgrid portal now displays the negotiated speed and duplex values:\nAnd it now allows you to change from the default Auto negotiation setting to a manual setting. This is frequently necessary when the connected port is hard set to a speed and duplex value, which breaks auto negotiation.\nAlert Improvements Alert Suppression Window Events An Alert Suppression Window prevents the Trustgrid system from sending notification to alarm channels for a scheduled period of time. This is useful for preventing noisy alerts during planned maintenance. Historically, correlating events to this time period required remembering when the maintenance occurred.\nAfter the suppression window is closed, either by cancelling or allowing it to expire, two events are created. One for the scheduled start:\nAnd another for the actual end time:\nThese events are viewable at both the node and organization level to make it easy to correlate events to the maintenance window.\nOverride Domain Level Threshold Alerts Threshold alerts, such as CPU % or latency, can be configured to apply to all nodes within a domain. But sometimes it is necessary for a specific node to have different thresholds defined. With this release, the domain thresholds can be overridden.\nIf you navigate to the Alerts panel of a node, you will see a section at the bottom titled Global Alerts. It will list all threshold alerts defined at the higher, domain level. Click the Override button to set a node specific value.\nDefine a new threshold value or duration\nAfter you click Save, the value will have a yellow square to indicate it is an override.\nThreshold Alerts Included Data Points Previously it wasn’t always clear why a threshold alert, such as an alarm regarding latency, exceeded the configured threshold. Even if you connected immediate to the device and checked the latency might have returned to normal.\nNow the JSON payload sent to alarm channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.) can include the data points used to calculate the average that exceeded the threshold. This is in a new section called details and the values are in pairs of the timestamp t (unix time) and value v (in milliseconds in the example below).\nAlert Payload ... \"details\":\t{ \"values\":\t[ {\"t\":1645664460,\"v\":1310}, {\"t\":1645664520,\"v\":1310}, {\"t\":1645664580,\"v\":31}, {\"t\":1645664640,\"v\":31}, {\"t\":1645664700,\"v\":890} ], } ...

An additional IP address is assigned as a Cluster Virtual IP address that can move between the nodes if failover occurs.\nCertain settings such as network services and VPN settings can be configured for the cluster and these settings will override the individual node’s configuration.\nFormerly the active member was referred to as the “master.” We are in the process moving to the terms active and standby. This documentation will use those terms but elements in the UI may retain the master term. Requirements Nodes in the cluster must be using the same model of appliances Nodes must be able to create direct TCP connections with each other Nodes should be at the same site or have high-bandwidth, high-reliability, low-latency connections between the devices Active Member Determination The active member of a cluster is determined by the following factors:\nCluster heartbeat communication Cluster mode Configured master Cluster member health Cluster Heartbeat Communication Cluster members utilize a direct TCP connection to each other to determine if their partner is online and share their health status. Each node will listen on a configured heartbeat IP and port, while at the same time connecting to their partner’s configured heartbeat IP and port.\nLocal ACLs allow only the partner cluster member to connect to the listening port. Heartbeat communication is configured on each node’s cluster page.\nCluster Mode A cluster can be configured in two different modes to determine what happens when a failed member returns to healthy status:\nAutomatic Failback (Default) - In this mode the member set as the Configured Master (see below) will maintain the active/master role as long as it is online and healthy. Manual Failback - In this mode, the active/master role only moves if either the current holder fails or the configured master is changed Consider a cluster with members named Node1, the configured master, and Node2.\nEvent Automatic Failback - Active Member Manual Failback - Active Member Initial State Node1 Node1 Node1 unhealthy/offline Node2 Node2 Node1 returns to healthy/online Node1 Node2 Configured Master Each cluster will have one configured or preferred active member. This is reflected in the overview section.\nA node may be designated as the preferred active member by selecting the node and clicking the “Set as Master” action\nThe Configured Master field will change immediately, but the Current Master may take a minute to reflect the change as the nodes process the change and notify the control plane.\nCluster Member Health There may be situations where both cluster members are online and can communicate with each other, but external conditions exist that make a node unsuitable to hold the active role. The Trustgrid node service monitors for such conditions and will make a node as unhealthy if one occurs. The node will release the active role and its standby member will take over if it is online and healthy.\nWhen the condition clears the node will declare itself healthy and inform its partner member. Depending on the cluster mode it may reclaim the active role.\nCluster Member Health Conditions Loss of cluster heartbeat communication - If a node cannot communicate with its partner nodes on the configured IP and port it will declare that partner node unhealthy and claim the active role if it has not already.\nInterface Link (Up/Down) State - Any interface configured with an IP address in the Trustgrid is monitored for a successful connection to another network device\nExample: In a two-interface setup it would be possible for the LAN interface to become unplugged but the node to remain online from the cloud and data plane perspective. However, the lack of LAN connectivity would prevent the node from delivering any Trustgrid services to that network Note: If only a single node has an interface configured, such as an alternate MPLS path, Trustgrid support can configure it to be ignored for triggering. Upstream Internet Issues - If a Trustgrid node is unable to build connections to both the Trustgrid control plane AND data plane connections to its gateways the node will be marked as unhealthy. This does require all the connections to be failing before it is triggered\nExample: If an upstream internet provider or device experiences failure the node will not be able to provide any services. WAN Interface DHCP failure - If the WAN interface is configured to use DHCP and it does not receive a DHCP lease it will mark itself unhealthy.\nLayer 4 (L4 Proxy) Service Health Check - TCP L4 Proxy Services can be configured to regularly perform health checks to confirm a successful connection can be made. If these checks fail 5 times in a row the service will mark the cluster member as unhealthy.\nExample: If each cluster member’s LAN interface is connected to a different switch and one switch fails that member will be unable to connect to any IP:ports dependent on that path.\nUse caution before configuring multiple services with health checks. This could create a situation where both nodes declare themselves unhealthy because a single service is failing if the server providing the service goes offline. Cluster Member Shared Configuration Cluster members can share the configuration for the following services:\nNetworking Interfaces Interface routes Cluster VIP (supported in on-premise, traditional network environment) AWS/Azure/GCP route table entries VPN Tunnels VRFs ZTNA gateway endpoints Layer 4 services and connectors Compute Container and command definitions Resource limits Tags Tags are visible at the bottom of the overview page for the resource.\nModifying Tags To add a tag:\nClick Add Tag.\nA new row will appear at the bottom of the tags table. There will be a list of existing tag names for your organization. You can filter the list by typing in the field. You can either select an existing tag name, or create a new one by typing it out in full and then selecting New selection: tagName.\nNext move to the values field. As with the name, existing values will be listed. To enter a new value type it in completely.\nClick Save\nTag rows can be edited in-place. Change the name or value, then click Save.\nTo remove a tag, click the red X next to the tag name, then click Save.\nApplying a Tag Filter to the Clusters Table The clusters table can also be filtered to only show clusters with a specific tag name:value.\nOn the clusters table click Actions and select Add Tag Filter from the drop-down menu. After clicking Add Tag Filter, select the tag-name field and you will see a list of tag-names available. Select the desired tag. You can also start typing to filter what tag names are shown.\nSelect the tag value field and you will see a list of available values. Select the desired value.\n(Optional) Click Add Tag Filter to include an additional filter.

Any Docker container is supported with the exception of containers that require root level access.\nThe container can be attached to both the local and virtual network space which allows both local and remote resources to communicate with the container. For example an API could be deployed on a Trustgrid Gateway which sends API Calls via the virtual network space to a container running on a Trustgrid Edge Node. The API call could then be translated to make a call to a database running on the local network and passed back up to the gateway host.\nBefore adding a container to a node, push an image to your repository.\nReading and managing containers requires node-exec::read and node-exec::modify permissions, respectively. Executing a container requires node-exec::compute permission.\nManagement Navigate to Container Management under Compute on a node or cluster.\nHere you can add, enable, disable, delete, and import a container.\nField Name Description Name The name of the container. Execution Type A container can be deployed as one of three types.\nService - the container is created and will run as a daemon. If the node reboots, the container will start up automatically.\nRecurring - the container will run on a defined schedule. A schedule parameter is defined for the frequency, either as a rate or a cron expression.\nRate Description rate(30 minutes) Run every 30 minutes rate(1 hour) Run every hour rate(1 day) Run every day On Demand - typically used for testing. The container is executed for a single session, but will not restart on its own.\nStatus Only enabled containers will run. Image Name The name of the image to execute. Image Tag The image tag to execute. Overview Navigating into a container, the overview section allows editing basic information about the container’s execution environment.\nContainer Overview In addition to the fields above, you can modify the below optional fields after saving the new container configuration.\nField Name Description Save Output Persist standard output/standard error to the Trustgrid cloud for analysis.\nIt is the customer’s responsibility to ensure no privileged information is included in the output. If in doubt, do not utilize this feature.\nCommand The command to execute inside the container. This overrides the start command configured by the dockerfile used to build the image and can be useful for troubleshooting. Hostname The hostname set inside the container.\nDefaults to the the node name.\nStop Time The grace period (in seconds) to allow a container to stop before killing it. Defaults to 30 seconds. User Sets the username or group or uid or gid in the container. DNS Configures the container to utilize the specified DNS server for resolution.\nBy default the container uses a local resolver managed by the node software that can resolve other containers by name and will forward to the node’s configured DNS servers for external resolution.\nIP Configures the container to use the specified IP address. The IP address needs to be in the 172.18.0.0/16 network and cannot be 172.18.1.2.\nBy default this is assigned dynamically in that network.\nPrivileged Grant the container extended privileges. Best practice would be to utilize linux capabilities to grant the least privileges needed to run the container. Use Init Use an init process inside the container as PID 1. This ensures responsibilities of an init system are performed inside the container (e.g., handling exit signals). Require Connectivity Ensures that the container will not start if it has encrypted volumes and is unable to reach the control plane. Environment Variables Environment variables can be added to a container to provide configuration information to the container at runtime.\nNetwork The networking section allows you to configure the container’s VRF, its port mappings, and its virtual networks and interfaces.\nHost Port Mappings Host port mappings allow you to expose a port on the host to the container. This is useful for exposing a service running in the container to the local network.\nField Name Description Protocol The protocol to listen for. If not specified, all traffic is forwarded to the container. Host Interface The host interface to listen on. Host Port The host port to listen on. Container Port The container port that will receive the mapped traffic. Virtual Networks Attaching a virtual network to a container allows virtual network traffic to reach it.\nField Name Description Virtual Network The virtual network to attach. Virtual IP The virtual IP to assign to the container. Allow Outbound Whether the container should be allowed to make outbound connections into the virtual network. Virtual Interfaces A virtual interface can be mapped to a container to forward all traffic.\nField Name Description Name The virtual interface name. Destination The interface destination inside the container. Mounts Mounts allow a container to persist data either as an externally defined volume, or a bind mount of the node’s filesystem.\nField Name Description Type Either BIND or VOLUME. For type VOLUME, the mount must reference an existing volume. Source For volumes, the name of the volume. For bind mounts, the path on the node’s filesystem. Destination The mount location inside the container. Resource Limits Containers can be restricted to limit the amount of resources they can consume from the host.\nField Name Description CPU Max % Maximum CPU allocation. Default is 50%. Memory Max (MB) Hard limit for RAM allocation. Default is 50% of the host’s memory. Memory High (MB) Soft limit for RAM allocation. Cannot exceed hard limit. Default is 45% of the host’s memory. IO Max Read (B/s) Max allowed bytes per second of IO reads. Disabled by default. IO Max Write (B/s) Max allowed bytes per second of IO writes. Disabled by default. IO Max Read Operations (ops/s) Max allowed IO read operations per second. Disabled by default. IO Max Write Operations (ops/s) Max allowed IO write operations per second. Disabled by default. Linux ulimits can be set for each container. Supported ulimits are:\nCORE DATA FSIZE LOCKS MEMLOCK MSGQUE NICE NOFILE NPROC RSS RTPRIO RTTIME SIGPENDING STACK Health Check A health check can be configured to monitor the container’s health. If the health check fails, the container will be restarted.\nField Name Description Command The command to run. A non-zero return code indicates a health check failure. Interval The frequency (in seconds) to run the health check. Timeout How long (in seconds) to wait for the health check to complete. A timeout is considered a failure. Start Period Grace period (in seconds) during container startup before health checks should start. Retries Number of allowed health check failures before marking the container unhealthy. Linux Capabilities Linux capabilities can be added to or removed from a container, allowing fine-grained control over kernel-level features and device access.\nLogging Configuration Log files (when persisting container output) are rotated based on a size threshold.\nField Name Description Max File Size (MB) The maximum size (in MB) of a log file before it is rotated. Max Files The maximum number of log files to keep.

As we began supporting additional services, such as Remote Access applications, more flexibility was needed.\nOpenID Support OpenID is a newer standard for managing communication between an application and an Identity Provider (IdP). It offers additional functionality compared to SAML including the ability to simplify integration.\nAt this point, Trustgrid supports simplified integration with Google G Suite and Microsoft AzureAD which includes the ability to synchronize groups and group members. Trustgrid will expand this functionality to other IdPs in the future but for now, other OpenID compatible IdPs can be integrated using a more generic OpenID setup process.\nSAML Self-Service Trustgrid will continue to support SAML integration. Previously the setup process required the Trustgrid Support Team to complete the configuration, but now this is available to Administrators.\nAdd Users Instead of Inviting Them Previously, adding new users to the Trustgrid portal was a bit clunky when using the SAML integration. To add a user you would:\nInvite the user. This would generate an email which the user didn’t really need.\nThe user would then need to successfully authenticate via the configured IdP.\nYou could then adjust the user’s role to reflect the appropriate permissions.\nNow, when an IdP is configured there is a simplified process:\nFrom the User Management panel click “Add User”\nFrom a single prompt, you can enter the user’s email address (matching what is configured in the Identify Provider), set their Role, and select the correct Identity Provider (if there is more than one).\nThe option to Invite Users is still available under Actions if you need to create users in the Trustgrid native IdP.\nDomain Improvements In addition to the changes outlined below, it is worth noting that Domains have been moved under the Management section of the navigation bar.\nReview Changes Trustgrid Domains encompass configuration settings that impact many nodes and clusters, such as Virtual Network Routes. The impacts of changes here can have a wide effect and it is not uncommon for multiple members of a team to be working in this context at the same time without knowing it.\nTo address this Trustgrid has updated the user interface to reduce the risk of improper or conflicting changes. After a change is made within a domain it is not immediately applied.\nInstead, a warning icon will be added to the Review Changes panel. Navigating to this panel will display all changes that are waiting to be applied.\nThe changes will include the user making the change. If more than one user has made changes they can confirm with that user if they are ready for that change to go into effect.\nOptionally, if they determine one of the changes should not be applied it can be removed by clicking the red X. Be aware that if this is done the change would have to be recreated and reviewed to add later.\nOnce the user has confirmed the changes look correct they can click Apply Changes. You will be prompted to confirm and then the changes will be pushed out to nodes in the domain.\nImproved Virtual Network Routes Table The Virtual Network Routes table has been significantly reworked in this release.\nThe biggest improvement is in the Destination selection method. The old interface required selecting from a long list of all nodes and clusters in the domains which became unmanageable as the number of these increased. Additionally, there was no distinguishing between nodes and clusters beyond the name.\nNow when the Destination field is selected you are given a list (typeahead filtered) that now has a prefix of Cluster or Node to clearly identify the destination type.\nAdditionally, the Save and Add Routes buttons have been moved to the top of the table to reduce the need to scroll down as you work.\nNo-NAT Virtual Networks Making Network Address Translation (NAT) easier to manage and scale has been a primary use case for Trustgrid. However, there are some situations where altering the IP addresses is unnecessary and even undesirable.\nTo address this we have added the ability to create a Virtual Network that will perform no address translation by default. This should greatly increase the ease of configuring such networks.\nWhen adding a new Virtual Network set the “No NAT Mode” to Yes. For a Network CIDR just enter 0.0.0.0/0, this field will be made optional in a later release.\nAfter creation, you will see that NO-NAT Mode is enabled in the table.\nWhenever this network is attached to a Node or Cluster interface you will see a notice like the below.\nVPN Improvements The VPN interface in the portal has been reworked in ways we hope will simplify the experience when configuring and managing.\nFeature Navigation Panels The legacy VPN page frequently required significant scrolling to get to the most relevant section. The new interface breaks these sections into multiple panels.\nSince Address Translation is the most commonly used section it is automatically selected when you navigate into the VPN context.\nImproved Multiple Virtual Network Support Trustgrid has supported Nodes and Clusters being attached to multiple Virtual Networks but the user experience interacting with them was cumbersome. For example, in a number of places, you had to select from a list of all the available virtual networks, even if they weren’t attached. This experience has been greatly improved.\nVPN Virtual Networks Table If the Node or Cluster is already attached to a single Virtual Network this will be selected automatically when you select the VPN navigation link. However, if you have multiple networks you will be presented with a table of only the attached Virtual Networks.\nThe Actions dropdown of this table will enable you to Attach additional Virtual Networks or Detach the current Virtual Networks.\nOverview Virtual Network Graph Previously the Overview Virtual Network graph listed all Virtual Networks within a domain. Now it will only show attached networks.\nVPN Toolbar Once you have navigated to the VPN context of a node and selected a Virtual Network you will see a bar like the below at the top of the page. The bar provides important data about the Virtual Network including the node’s Virtual Management IP (and the ability to edit it).\nClicking the Tools button on the right of the bar brings up a menu of both Virtual Network and Interface tools. Users no longer have to switch between tabs to access these different toolsets.\nNew Virtual Translation Table Interface The View Virtual Translation Table shows active NATs similar to a show connections command from legacy solutions. Previously running this tool produced raw console output that could be challenging to work with when there were large numbers of active connections.\nThe new version of the tools creates a paginated table that is easily searchable and can be refreshed without needing to return to the Tools section.\nProxyARP Option for Outside NATs Previously the Trustgrid node would ARP on the local network for any IP contained in the Local CIDR of an outside NAT. For example, if your Outside NAT Local CIDR was for 192.168.1.0/24, the node would respond to ARP requests for any IP in that network (192.168.1.1 - .254).\nThis is still the default behavior, but there is now an option to disable this functionality when configuring Outside NATs.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Improved Identity Provider Integration Trustgrid has supported SAML …","ref":"/release-notes/cloud/archive/2021/march/","tags":"","title":"March"},{"body":"Data Plane Panel Improvements In the February 2022 release we introduced the Data Plane status panel for investigating connections between edge and gateway nodes. With this release we’ve added some tools to this panel. The new Ping and Test Performance tools are linked in the far right column of each gateway’s row.\nGateway Ping The gateway ping tool will launch a ping inside the data plane tunnel between the node and the gateway, similar to ICMP ping. This can provide a more realtime view of latency between node and gateway compared to the RTT column (only loaded on refresh) and the historical data which provides a minute by minute view.\nGateway Performance Tool The gateway performance tool attempts to estimate the available upload bandwidth between a node and gateway.\nBy default this tool will attempt to send 10MB of data to the destination device. This then used to calculate the available bandwidth. Sending more data provides a more accurate estimate but be aware that other devices using the same internet circuit may experience degraded performance while the test is running.\nThe periods are posted for about every 1MB of data sent. If you see exclamation marks this can indicate lost packets.\nTool Improvements MTR Improvements MTR, which was recently added to the portal, can be powerful troubleshooting tool, but it has many options which can be tricky for newer users. To simplify the use we’ve added a new user interface that provides graphical options for selecting common parameters.\nAWS Instances Metadata When the Trustgrid software is deployed in AWS we can gather additional metadata about the underlying instance. With this release we have added the availability zone, instances type and instance ID to the Info panel available on every node.\nTimestamps for Virtual Network Changes Before changes are committed to a virtual network setting, such as the virtual network route table, they are listed in the Changes panel for approval. This made it easier to see if other users had outstanding changes that might be in conflict. However, it wasn’t clear if the other user just made that change or if it had been left accidentally. With this release we’ve added a timestamp that shows when the user saved the change.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Data Plane Panel Improvements In the February 2022 release we …","ref":"/release-notes/cloud/archive/2022/march/","tags":"","title":"March"},{"body":" A domain is the logical grouping of nodes inside an organization.\nDomains are a logical grouping of nodes, allowing configuration of virtual networks and node thresholds.

This allows you to trace the route or run MTR diagnostics directly between the current node and the selected peer.\nThis is most effective if run from the client/edge node to a gateway since the gateway is the only one actually listening on that port. If run in the other direction (gateway -\u003e client) it is likely any firewall between will drop the connections and the client will definitely not respond on that port.

As Trustgrid has expanded our feature set, adding features like containers, and our user base have grown the predefined role structure has become a poor fit. Many times these new features required Trustgrid Support to grant access to users. Additionally, what each role could and could not do was opaque to customers.\nWith this release will be migrating to a policy-based approach that will allow customers to independently tailor permissions to meet their own use cases. Customers will also be able to see exactly what rights policies allow and what policy is granting a user access directly in the portal.\nThis migration will also allow future enhancements such as automatic policy assignment based on group membership, resource based policies limiting users to specific nodes/clusters, and more.\nHow it Works The new policy permission works as such:\nUsers can be attached to one or more policy Policies are defined that either allow or explicitly deny permissions or actions Permission are grouped according to the related feature/objects set Read allows a user to view that group of related objects Modify will allow users to add, change or delete those objects Additional actions such as running tools on a node can be allowed/denied A denied permission will override any allowed permission in another policy Migration of Role Permissions to Policies Trustgrid previously had 4 predefined roles. With this release these will be migrated into 5 new builtin policies, and an additional policy will be created. As part of this migration Trustgrid is also making sure these policies only include the “least-privileges” required to perform the intent of each of the previously defined roles.\nDuring the release process users previously assigned a role will be automatically assigned the corresponding policy or policies listed below\nBelow is a list of our historic roles and the policies that replace them plus any known changes. If users previously assigned a role lose a tool or function they need, they can either be attached to a higher level builtin policy with the appropriate permissions or a custom policy can be created and attached.\nMonitor (now tg-builtin-monitor policy) Changes:\nMonitor no longer has access to troubleshooting tools. These were removed because some of these seemed to exceed the privileges required for the user types expected to have this role. Operator (now tg-builtin-operator policy) No changes.\nNode-Administrator (now tg-builtin-node-admin policy) No changes.\nAdministrator (now tg-builtin-admin and tg-builtin-access-admin policy) The administrator role previously included both the ability to make almost all technical changes and the ability to control access and permission to the portal.\nTrustgrid determined that these functions are separate and many companies may want to further restrict the access administration to a subset of users. The functions have been split into two policies:\nbuiltin-tg-admin - Full access to make technical changes builtin-tg-access-admin - Ability to add or invite users, change and attach policies, and configure Identity Providers However, Trustgrid cannot determine who within an organization should and should not have each of these functions so during this migration any user that was previously assigned the Administrator role will be attached to both policies.\nIt is highly recommended customers review which users are attached to the builtin-tg-access-admin policy and remove from those that do not require it.\nProvisioning Order Improvements Contacts and Stakeholders Orders historically only had fields for a general order contact and a technical contact. With this release additional stakeholders can be listed (such as a project manager associated with the project or other executive contacts).\nThe goal is to eventually provide a method to send status updates to all contacts in a more automated fashion as order progress.\nAdd Provisioning Contacts for your Organization If you have stakeholders that will frequently be used on orders, you can add them as Contacts.\nThese will then be available to select in the stakeholders section of an order and will auto-polulate the fields\nActivity Report The new Activity Report will list all orders that transitioned to the selected Status during the selected Time Range and the results can be exported as a CSV. This can be useful for tracking progress of provisioning projects over time.\nRack Mount Field Added Some Trustgrid hardware has the option of including rack mounts. Previously this was documented in notes, but with this release a field has been added. If an appliance type does not have a rack mount option this will show as “unavailable”\nAccess to the Provisioning section of the portal is not a part of a builtin policy at this time. Access admins should create policies to grant users orders permissions and attach to the appropriate users.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Trustgrid Permissions Restructuring Trustgrid’s portal and API have …","ref":"/release-notes/cloud/archive/2022/may/","tags":"","title":"May"},{"body":" This page will show the most recent 1000 flow logs for the specific node being viewed.\nSee this page for more info on Flow Logs\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" This page will show the most recent 1000 flow logs for the specific …","ref":"/docs/nodes/flow-logs/","tags":"","title":"Node Flow Logs"},{"body":"Faster Node Overview Graphs With this release we have reduced the time it takes for the initial Overview graphs to load when you first navigate to the node.\nNew Time Range Selector Previously the Trustgrid portal used a few different time range selectors on different pages, none of which were the most user friendly.

This sometimes made it hard to compare as they had different scales. Now these data points are visible on a single graph. They can also be deselected with the graph scale adjusting automatically.\nSort Peers by Connected Status Previously the connected status column didn’t allow you to sort. If you had a lot of connected peers and wanted to focus on disconnected ones it was a challenge. Now you can sort by clicking on the column header.\nNode Location Tab There is a new Location panel under History on the node detail page. This page allows you to:\nSpecify the Latitude and Longitude of used to display the location of the node on the network map. You can utilize a map such as Google Maps to determine these coordinates Specify the City, State, Country and Zip where the node is deployed.

Flow Log Improvements In addition to the new time range selector, we have also improved how advanced searches return results. Previously, if your search included a long time range or was run on a node with a lot of flows the system could return partial results.

Interface Name Name assigned to the interface by the operating system. This varies between hardware models and is sometimes needed when using tools such as Sniff Interface or reviewing logs. Interface VRF Selects to which VRF the interface is attached. VLAN ID (Subinterfaces Only) Sets the VLAN ID/tag for the subinterface. IP Assignment (ETH0 only) DHCP - requires a DHCP server or relay in the same broadcast domain as the interface connection Static - configured using the fields below IPv4 Address CIDR IP address using classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. Gateway IP ETH0 - The IP address of the default gateway for this device. All traffic not in the same network as an interface IP or with a specified route will use this gateway. ETH1 - This is only used in a 2-interface setup to access local resources outside the interface’s configured network. Routes must be defined. DNS Server 1/2 IP (ETH0 only) Used to resolve DNS names to connect to the Trustgrid control plane. Cluster Virtual IP Used in clusters, this IP address is moved between member nodes based on the active cluster member. It can be used to route traffic between the virtual and local networks. This IP address can only be changed within the cluster interfaces page. MTU This field allows you to change the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the interface. MTU impacts the maximum size of packets sent or received on the interface. Auto-Negotiation Sets if the interface will use auto-negotiation to determine the speed and duplex settings.

We’ve added an optional HTTP endpoint that will listen on cluster members but will only return a 200 code on the active member of the cluster.\nThere is now a new section under System → Cluster for cluster members where you can define the port on which the node will listen. This endpoint will always listen on the WAN interface IP.\nRequires node version 20220808 or newer\nEnable Different Interface Routes for Cluster Members Traditionally, cluster members share the interface routes configured at the cluster level. This is usually desirable, but certain situations can require each member to have a different route defined. For example, If you have deployed your cluster members in different AWS Availability Zones for redundancy and you have the heartbeat communication on a LAN interface each would need a different route.\nWith this release you will see the ability to “Add Entry” for additional routes under the LAN interface section of cluster members. You will also see a read-only entry with a blue square for any cluster-defined route.\nData Plane Panel Improvements Easier Peer Selection Previously, to select a node in the data plane peers table you had to click exactly on the node’s name.

These are the only nodes that need to have ports open and listening on the internet or WAN network.\nThe server sub-panel provides the settings controlling if a node will act as a server and if so how clients will connect to it.\nGateway Server Types A gateway server can be one of three types:\npublic - all nodes, except other public gateways, in an organization will attempt to connect to this gateway on the listed IP/DNS name and port private - allows only allow-listed clients to connect hub - allows connections from edge nodes and other gateway nodes Settings Field Name Description Enabled Either Enabled or Disabled. This determines if the main TLS Gateway server will be started or not. When enabled, the node will listen and accept connections from other nodes on the Public IP and DNS and port.\nIf this setting is set to Disabled the below settings are extraneous and not used, with the exception of UDP enabled as it is also a client setting.\nUDP Enabled This settings can be configured on both the gateway server and gateway client sub-panel.\nOn a server, this will determine if the server will listen for UDP tunnel connections on the configured UDP port. On a client, this will determine if the client will attempt to build UDP tunnels to any server with UDP enabled. UDP tunnels are only attempted if both the client and the server have the UDP Enabled field set to Enabled\nPublic IP or DNS The public IP or DNS name of the gateway. This is the address that other nodes will use to connect to this gateway. Port The TCP port that the gateway will listen on. This is the port that other nodes will use to connect to this gateway. UDP Port The UDP port that the gateway will listen on for UDP tunnels. This is the port that other nodes will use to connect to this gateway. Max Ingress Mbps The ingress bandwidth limit for the gateway. Connections will be throttled when this limit is reached. Certificate Optional When using DNS for gateway connections, you may specify an uploaded certificate to use for TLS connections. If not specified the certificate autogenerated during activation is used. Gateway Type The type of gateway. See Gateway Types for more information. After changing any of the above settings you will need to click Save for the changes to go into effect.\nEnabling and disabling the gateway server will require a restart of the node service which will disrupt all node functionality for a brief period. Example Gateway Server settings Gateway Clients This section is only used if the node is configured as a private gateway server. Only clients listed on this page will attempt to connect to the server.\nAdd Gateway Clients To add clients:\nType part of their name in the “Add Gateway Client” box. Example showing filtered list of nodes Select the desired node from the list. After selecting you should see the node in the table with Enabled set to true. Selected node added to table Optionally, repeat the above steps with additional nodes to add as clients. Click Save.

While connected and disconnected were clear, there was little information on why the status was Degraded.\nWith this release hovering over the Data Plane status icon will bring up a pop-up screen showing all the peers and and their connection status. Additionally, if the peer is connected it will show:\nThe public IP of the peer The mode used to connect to with the peer (TLS or UDP) The route trip time (RTT) between the devices when the tool was last run. This data can be searched and refreshed. In a future release we will make historical RTT time viewable for each peer.\nFlow Log Improvements Flow logs provide valuable metadata about traffic across Trustgrid networks but our search had performance and reliability issues that made it difficult to use. With this release we’ve rearchitected how search these logs to allow for a significant performance improvement.\nImproved IP Geolocation Data Trustgrid has changed our public IP geolocation data providers to improve the accuracy of the information we use to place nodes on our Network Maps. This new provider will also allow us to present additional information such as ISP and ASN in the future, which could be handy for identifying when multiple devices from the same ISP or ASN start having issues.\nCustom Portal Roles Trustgrid is working on moving our permission structure beyond the four default roles (Monitor, Operator, Node-Administrator and Administrator) to allow customers to tailor roles to just the permissions their users need. For example, you could allow a user Monitor (read-only) permissions to most of the Trustgrid environment but grant them the ability to stop and start containers.\nCurrently this requires working with Trustgrid Support to define these new roles but once defined they can be assigned by Node Administrators and Administrators.\nOther Improvements You can now search the Nodes table for Management IPs and Device types Fixed a broken link in the new user invite email for customers without IDP integration ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Data Plane Status Table Previously Trustgrid had a visual indicator on …","ref":"/release-notes/cloud/archive/2021/december/","tags":"","title":"December"},{"body":"Trustgrid uses each node’s public IP address to derive location information.

When launched the java process claims a minimum amount of memory from the operating system. As the process runs additional memory can be claimed up to a configured maximum. Not all of this memory is actively in use by Java. Once the maximum amount of memory has been claimed or a period of time has elapsed Java will run a garbage collection process to free up pages of memory that are no longer being actively used.\nThe JVM Heap statistic shows how much of the claimed memory is actively being used.

There are three main types of nodes - Edge, Gateway, and Management.\nAll Trustgrid nodes run on a hardened Ubuntu operating system. Nodes are managed through the Trustgrid portal or via the API (requires authentication token). A local UI exists to support the reconfiguration of an ethernet interface and diagnostic/network tests prior to connection to the Portal.\nEdge Nodes Edge Nodes build outgoing TLS tunnels to Gateway Nodes. Bidirectional traffic is supported through this tunnel, subject to ACLs and security policy restrictions. Edge Nodes will only require a firewall rule change if outbound internet restrictions are in place. Edge nodes can be a target for software deployment. Edge Nodes can be deployed with a single or multiple ethernet connections to support deployments behind a firewall or adjacent to a firewall (public WAN / private LAN).\nGateway Nodes Gateway Nodes accept incoming TLS tunnels from Edge Nodes. Traffic on these tunnels is bidirectional, as permitted by ACLs or policy. Gateway Nodes usually require a firewall change to permit the incoming traffic. Gateway Nodes are identical to Edge Nodes but with a gateway configuration applied. Gateway nodes only connect to other gateways if one is of type hub. Read more about gateway configuration.\nManagement Nodes Management Nodes are not like other nodes because they do not connect to the data plane, only the control plane. Management Nodes are deployed by Trustgrid for each customer and are multi-tenant like other control plane components. Customers may elect to deploy their own Management Nodes in place of multi-tenant Management Nodes. Management Nodes facilitate the monitoring, management, and support of Edge and Gateway Nodes.\nNode List View Adding Nodes - Generating Licenses A node needs a license generated by the Trustgrid control plan to register with your organization. This license can be generated in the portal from the Nodes page.\nNavigate to the Nodes list view. Click the Add Node button. Add Node button on Nodes page Enter a name for the node and click Create License. Node Name prompt A license key will be generated and displayed. Clicking in the license text window will automatically copy the license into your clipboard, or you can click the Download License button. Example license key Adding a Tag as a Column on the Nodes Table Adding a tag as a column on the nodes tables is good way to make valuable information visible for multiple nodes at the same time. To add the column:\nNavigate to the nodes table page Click Actions and then select Columns from the dropdown Towards the bottom you will see all the available tags in the format tag: tag-name. Select the desired tag and click Save. The column will be added and the table can now be sorted by that column. Any node that does not have that tag set will be listed as blank.\nApplying a Tag Filter to the Nodes Table The nodes table can also be filtered to only show nodes with a specific tag name:value.\nOn the nodes table click Actions and select Add Tag Filter from the drop-down menu.

In this configuration, the node can be used as the next hop for route destined for the virtual IP space, or the node can be used as the default gateway for a network. The virtual IP space is used as a transit network with NAT being utilized to translate IP addresses on to/from the virtual IP space on either side. It is also possible to preserve the original source and destination by having the virtual IP space be identical to the LAN network.\nThe Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between remote networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how local node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nAttaching a Virtual Network To use VPN functionality, a node or cluster must be attached to a domain virtual network.\nNavigate to the VPN section for your node or cluster, and select Actions-\u003eAttach.\nAttach Virtual Network dialog on a Node Field Name Description Select Network Drop down list to select defined virtual networks.

VRFs can be associated to an interface whether it be a physical interface / virtual network interface or other tunnel interfaces such as ipsec or gre. VRFs are segmented on a layer 3 level from all other traffic traversing the Trustgrid node.\nFor standard use cases of source nat and/or destination nat creating a route and a NAT is sufficient. Traffic rules can be used for more advanced controls. An applicable ACL is required for any traffic to pass as a zero trust methodology is applied.\nAddress Translation This is where NATs are created in order to translate the traffic to appear as desired on the network. NATs support translating both source and destination CIDRs as well as masquerading as the egress interface address.\nSNAT / DNAT Example Using the example NAT below if a source packet was initiated from 10.10.10.100 destined for 10.10.20.100 the source address would be translated to 192.168.10.100 and the destination address would be translated to 192.168.20.100. It is important to note that nat translations occur before routing decisions are made.\nMaquerade Example Using the example below if a source packet is initiated from within 10.10.10.0/24 destined for anything in 192.168.10.0/24 the source would be translated to the interface address the packet is egressing on. If it was a single interface Trustgrid node it would be sourced as the wan facing interface address.\nRoutes Note that NAT translations happen before routing so routes should be created for the destination NAT CIDR if applicable. Routes require a destination CIDR, interface and metric. A next hop is optional and only applicable for non-tunnel interfaces such as physical interfaces or vlan subinterfaces. The gateway of the applicable interface will be used if no next hop is defined.\nThe example below would be used for example to offload all internet bound traffic directly out the WAN facing interface\nTraffic Rules Traffic rules can be used for more advanced granular traffic manipulation beyond standard source and destination nat. There are many more parameters that can be applied to the traffic depending on the specific use case. When creating a traffic rule an ACL is required for traffic to pass. The available parameters are defined below. Rules are evaluated based on the line number. The first matching rule is the one that will be applied to the packet. More specific rules should always be implemented above less specific rules. Eg a rule for a /24 network should be above a /16 network the /24 is included in.\nField Name Description Number The line number the rule is applied to. Rules are matched in numerical order. Action All traffic rules have an action that is applied to the associated packet.\nAccept - The packet is allowed to be processed locally. Drop - The packet is dropped and not responded to Reject - A TCP Reset is sent in response Forward - The packet is forwarded to its defined destination such as an interface or another VRF Mirror - Packets are not manipulated but can be mirrored for inspection purposes. For example passing through an IDS container such as Snort. Log - The packet is not manipulated but is marked for logging Ingress Interface The traffic rule is applied to packets that ingress on this interface Forward Interface Packets are forwarded out this interface once the rule is applied Protcol The protocol that the rule should apply to. All, ICMP, TCP or UDP Forward VRF Packets are forwarded into another VRF that is associated on the node. Only configureable when a forward action is selected. Source CIDR The source network the rule should apply to Destination CIDR The destination network the rule should apply to Masquerade Translate and source all packets from the nodes interface address when enabled DNAT Destination Forward all traffic to the DNAT destination IP/Port. For example in order to forward all http traffic through a proxy Destination Mac The destination mac address defined overwrites the source mac address of the packet. Necessary only for some container deployments such as Snort inpsecting traffic. Ports Used to define a port range when creating a traffic rule Traffic Rule Example In the below example the first rule on line number 1 is forwarding all traffic destined to 10.0.20.0/24 to a virtual network tunnel interface. Any NATs configured under Address Translation will be applied before the packet is forwarded to its destination. The rule on line number 10 will forward all traffic that does not match the first rule out to the internet masquerading as the WAN interfaces address. If the line numbers were reversed the virtual network rule would never be matched as all traffic would match the internet offload rule which is configured for all source and destination traffic.\n","categories":["node"],"description":"","excerpt":"Overview VRFs can be used route / nat and filter what traffic is …","ref":"/docs/nodes/vrfs/","tags":["vrfs","networking"],"title":"VRFs"},{"body":"Navigate to a node, then select ZTNA Gateway under the Network section.\nHTTPS Endpoint The HTTPS endpoint is used to provide connectivity for non-WireGuard ZTNA applications.\nField Name Description Enabled When enabled, this node will listen for ZTNA traffic.

Example of a saved route Route Failover Route failover allows a subnet to be routed to an alternate node or cluster in the event of a failure. This can be automatic or performed manually.\nPrerequisites In either configuration, the virtual network settings under VPN settings for the primary and backup destination nodes/clusters must match. Including:\nNetwork Virtual Route\nNetwork Group under Outside NAT Table\nVirtual CIDR under Inside NAT Table\nAutomatic Failover To have the route failover without manual intervention you must define two routes for the same subnet (Destination CIDR) with different metrics. The lowest numerical metric will take precedence unless the destination node or cluster is offline.\nIn the below example configuration we want traffic for the 10.20.0.0/24 network to the edge cluster first, and failover to the edge-dr cluster.\nPreventing Automated Failback or Forcing a Failover As mentioned above if multiple routes are configured traffic will route to destination with the lowest metric number. So if the primary destination fails but then comes back online traffic will be routed back automatically.\nHowever, there are some circumstances where this is not desirable. For example, if the primary site is unstable you may wish to keep traffic at the backup site until the primary is stabilized. Alternately, you may wish to preemptively reroute traffic to the backup site in advance of planned maintenance at the primary site.\nTo preemptively reroute traffic to the backup site, update the backup route to have a lower metric than the primary route.\nManual Failover In some circumstances, it may be preferable for failover to only occur with manual intervention. In this situation, you will have a single route under the domain. To initiate a failover you’ll need to update the destination cluster/node.\nLogin to the Portal and select your domain. Click the link to the desired domain under the “Name” column. Scroll down to the “Virtual Networks” section and select the “Routes” tab. Find the route you wish to failover. Update the destination device. (e.g. in the below you would switch from edge to edge-dr). Click save.

They can be used to troubleshoot connectivity issues, or to monitor traffic patterns.\nWhat are flow logs? Flow logs are records containing metadata about each network traffic flow, or conversation, from the initial connection (e.g. the first SYN packet for TCP) to the closing of the connection (e.g. FIN or RST packets for TCP). Flow logs do not contain any payload data for the flow which makes them much smaller and more secure than a full packet capture of the same flow.\nFlow logs can be used for troubleshooting by:\nVerifying that both the expected source and destination node have the appropriate logs. That any NATs are applying as expected. That the expected number of flows or sent/received byte are being passed. TCP Flags can be used to confirm a successful connection is being made. For example: A TCP Flow with only a SYN flag is never completing the TCP Handshake process indicating an issue, such as a firewall or routing configuration problem, preventing the destination IP from either receiving packets or replying successfully A TCP Flow with only a SYN \u0026 RST flag indicates something in the path is actively resetting the connection attempt. This could be a firewall or an application IP restriction. Flow Log Data Below are the potential fields of a single flow log.\nField Name Description Start Time The time the flow started End Time The time the flow ended Protocol The protocol of the traffic TCP, UDP, ICMP Source Node The node that initiated the flow Source IP The IP address through which the node initiated the flow Source Port The port through which the node initiated the flow Dest Node The node that received the flow Dest IP The IP address to which traffic was sent Dest Port The port to which traffic was sent Recv Bytes Bytes received at the source node Sent Bytes Bytes sent from the source node TCP Flags All TCP Flags set on any packets seen over the duration of the flow:\nSYN - sync packet PSH - push packet ACK - ack packet URG - urgent packet FIN - finish packet RST - reset packet TCP Flags are only available for TCP flows that traverse the layer 3 VPN function. ICMP and UDP traffic, Layer 4 services and VPN Port Forwards will not have this data.\nNAT Impact on Source and Destination Fields When NATs are applied to a flow they will influence the source/destination IP and port values.\nConsider this flow:\ngraph LR client(HTTP Client\\n192.168.100.1) -- src: 192.168.100.1\\ndest: 10.100.1.1--\u003e Node1 subgraph Virtual Network Node1 -- src: 10.100.2.1\\ndest: 10.100.1.1 --\u003e Node2[Node2 \\n Local IP\\n172.16.1.100] end Node2 --src: 172.16.1.100 \\n dest:172.16.1.20 --\u003e server(HTTP Server\\n172.16.1.20) Node1 would report the flow before any NATs were applied\nSource IP Destination IP 192.168.100.1 10.100.1.1 Node2 would report the flow after the NATs on Node1 were applied (changing the source 10.100.2.1) and the NATs on Node2 were applied (changing the source to 172.16.1.100 and the destination to 172.16.1.20)\nSource IP Destination IP 192.168.100.1 10.100.1.1 Note: For simplicity sake ports were excluded. Destination ports will not be changed by NATs. Source ports would also be maintained for any 1:1 NAT, but would change if a many:1 (or overload) NAT was applied to the flow.

To filter by a field, click the Advanced Search button at the top right of the flow logs table.\nIn addition, the ordering can be changed so that oldest flows (or flows closest to the time range specified) can be shown first. There is a limit of 10,000 flows returned per search.\nAdvanced Search dialog Exporting Flow Logs to CSV From the Flow logs table you can export the current filtered logs to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting. Several fields are exported differently in the CSV file:\nBelow are the potential fields of a single flow log.\nField Name Description Start and End Time Both of these fields exported two different ways:\nHuman friendly in the format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM Timestamp in milliseconds since epoch for machine parsing TCP Flags TCP Flags are exported in hexadeximal format (e.g. 0x02 for SYN flag set) rather than the human friendly names. See the below section for more info on converting these values. Understanding TCP Flag Hex Values When exporting TCP flags to CSV, the values will be shown as hexadecimal numbers rather than the human readable names (e.g. SYN, ACK). The below table shows how each flag would be prepresented as a hex value or binary value.\nHex Value Binary Representation Flag Name Description 0x01 00000001 FIN Finish (end of data communication) 0x02 00000010 SYN Synchronize sequence numbers 0x04 00000100 RST Reset the connection 0x08 00001000 PSH Push function 0x10 00010000 ACK Acknowledgment 0x20 00100000 URG Urgent pointer field significant 0x40 01000000 ECE Explicit Congestion Notification Echo 0x80 10000000 CWR Congestion Window Reduced The CSV export will show the hex value that represents the combination of set flags. For example, a flow with SYN and ACK flags set would show the hex value 0x12 in the CSV, representing the binary value 00010010.\nNote: The value shown is the total of ALL flags seen on all packets that are part of the flow. If you are only used to looking at the flags of individual packets you will see combinations not normal in regular TCP traffic. For example a complete flow might have a SYN, ACK, RST and FIN. To convert hax flags to human readable format first convert to binary then check each bit position.\nTo convert hex to binary you can:\nan online tool like Binary to Hexadecimal Converter searching google.com using the prompt 0x## to binary (replacing the ## with the hex value) Use the =HEX2BIN(hex_value) function in Excel or Google sheets Then you can use the resulting bit map with a table like below to convert to human readable flags:\nExample Hex Binary Equivalent CWR ECE URG ACK PSH RST SYN FIN 0xd6 1101 0110 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0x1b 0001 1011 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Flow logs are a records of for network traffic that passes through a …","ref":"/help-center/flow-logs/","tags":"","title":"Network Flow Logs"},{"body":"Update Process DNS request for A record of repo.trustgrid.io The response will be IPs in the Trustgrid AWS networks, 35.171.100.16/28 (us-east-1) or 34.223.12.192/28 (us-west-2) The node will initiate a connection to port 443 on the ip address returned for repo.trustgrid.io The update process will download any updated packages using port Potential Issues Confirm connectivity on Port 443 Verify no DPI-SSL or HTTPS proxy is interfering with the SSL certificate for repo.trustgrid.io ","categories":"","description":"A step by step description of how a healthy node appliance upgrades.","excerpt":"A step by step description of how a healthy node appliance upgrades.","ref":"/help-center/kb/upgrade-process/","tags":"","title":"Node Upgrade Process"},{"body":"How a Node Appliance Upgrades The upgrade process will:\nUpgrade the Trustgrid application package. As part of this process the node will backup the current running version. Apply security updates to install operating system packages. Reboot the Trustgrid node appliance. For details on what this looks like from a network level see the Node Upgrade Process KB article.\nFrequently Asked Questions Is the upgrade disruptive? - Yes. While the appliance is upgrading services will remain available, though performance may be degraded. However, the reboot step will make all services unavailable until the appliance fully boots and starts the Trustgrid service. Typically this takes a few minutes depending on the underlying hardware. How long will the upgrade take? - This is highly variable but typically this takes between 10 minutes and an hour. Below are a list of things that influence how long the upgrade takes: Internet bandwidth - This determines how quickly the node can download the updates. Time since previous update - The longer a node goes without updating the more security packages are likely to be required. CPU and disk performance - The upgrade process involves significant CPU processing and to a lesser extent disk I/O. The upgrade process is single-threaded, so core speed is more important than number of cores. Best Practices Upgrade nodes regularly to ensure access to the latest features and security updates For clustered nodes: Upgrade the standby node Change the standby node to be the configured master/active and wait for it to claim this role. Upgrade the new standby node in the cluster Utilize an Alert Suppression Window to reduce the number of alarms generated if upgrading many nodes. Required Permissions In order to perform the below actions a user must have a policy applied with the following permissions to the nodes that will be upgraded.\n\"statements\": [ { \"effect\": \"allow\", \"actions\": [ \"nodes::read\", \"nodes::upgrade\", \"nodes::manage\", \"nodes::service:node-upgrade\", \"portal::access\" ] } ], The above is only a partial policy.

This is the only configuration that:\nSupports Single Node deployments Supports Single Interface configurations This configuration is not recommended for nodes acting as gateways. In this configuration devices are NAT’d to a different public IP depending on which ISP is active. A gateway node can only announce a single IP or DNS address for its clients to connect to. It would be possible to announce a DNS record and some form of dynamic DNS health check to update the record if the ISP changed. But that change would have to propagate which could take some time.

(Preview Feature) Node Registration from the Trustgrid Console This release includes a new feature that allows you to register a node from the Trustgrid console. This will allow a Trustgrid node running the a standard image to be registered with a Trustgrid account without needing to share a complete license token.\nThe high-level process is:\nA user with console access to a Trustgrid node logs in and initiates the registration process. This triggers a process that generates unique certificates for the node and generates a short activation code. The node will then begin checking with the Trustgrid control plane to see if it has been activated. This code can then be shared with a user with access to the Trustgrid portal. That user can then enter the code in the Trustgrid portal via the Activate Node action. After entering the code they are prompted to provide a name for the node and click License Node. When the node detects its code has been activated it finalizes registration and then reboots. The node is then available for use and configuration. This release also allows the user at the console to deregister a node. This will remove the node from the Trustgrid account and deactivate the license.\nThis feature is currently in preview and requires Trustgrid support to enable the feature for specific users.

There is now a Copy All button that will load all of these details into your clipboard.\nCopy All button Example WAN interface output:\nIP: 172.16.11.31/24 Hardware Address: 00:50:56:8e:03:54 Gateway: 172.16.11.1 DNS1: 172.16.11.4 DNS2: 4.2.2.2 Public IP Removed from WAN Interface The WAN interface used to include a field labeled “Public IP” that was the IP address the Trustgrid control plane saw as the source IP for traffic from the node. This would be the IP address used on the internet after any NATs where applied.\nSome users were confused by this IP and believed it was the assigned IP address for the WAN interface which is not always true. Therefore we have removed this from the WAN interface panel.\nThe observed Public IP is still visible in the Infovisor.\nData Plane Panel Export Data Plane Peers You can now export a CSV-formatted list of peers from the Data Plane panel. Export button List Gateway Ports The Data Plane Panel now lists the Gateway Port for each tunnel. This is the port the client node uses to connect to the listed gateway.\nWhile this is typically port 8443,, it can be configured differently and having that info visible aids in troubleshooting.\nBGP Status Tool A new BGP Status tool has been added to the BGP panel. This tool displays the current BGP peer status including peer connection status, uptime, routes received and advertised, and more. BGP Status Flow Logs Advanced Search Improvement The flow logs advanced search now allows selecting clusters as the source or destination nodes. This enables search for flows that were sent to or received from a cluster, rather than individual nodes.\nTrustgrid Resource Names (TGRN) in Infovisor When creating Resource Scoped Policies to limit a user’s visibility to specific nodes or clusters you specify resources using Trustgrid Resource Names (TGRNs). Prior to this release it was necessary to generate the TGRN for by combining the common prefix with the node’s UID. With this release the TGRN is available in the node’s Infovisor panel with a button to easily copy the TGRN into your clipboard.\nCopy TGRN field on Infovisor Override Default Container DNS and IP This release when combined with a node running the July 2023 Node releases adds the ability to override the default DNS and IP settings for containers.\nOther Notable Fixes The below issues have been resolved in this release:\nAdding and saving multiple tags use to frequently lead to an error that caused an endless status spinner and would fail to save one or more of the tags. Overview graphs were not aggregating statistics correctly for view of 6 hours or longer.* ","categories":"","description":"July Release focusing on general improvements and fixes","excerpt":"July Release focusing on general improvements and fixes","ref":"/release-notes/cloud/july-2023/","tags":"","title":"July 2023 Release Notes"},{"body":" Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20230712-1762 20230712-200223.7cced96 n-2.16.0 New Event Types Several new event types are generated with this version of the node appliance software.\nDNS Failure If the node is unable to resolve DNS via its configured DNS servers it will generate a DNS Resolution error event. Example DNS resolution events Interface Down Notification This event is triggered when any configured interface’s link state goes from UP to DOWN. Example Interface health events Trustgrid Unhealthy Stop Notification This event is triggered if the Trustgrid service fails to stop completely prior to the most recent start. This could indicate a hard power cycle event or something caused the Trustgrid service to halt unexpectedly.\nExample Node Stop Error Cluster Health Events The following cluster health related events are now available and will now resolve themselves once the triggering condition clears.\nNetwork Health Check Data and Control Plane Disruption Virtual Network Port Forwards Port forwards allow mapping a layer 4 service to a virtual IP address in a Trustgrid layer 3 virtual network. Prior to this release, port forwards could only be defined at the node or cluster level and this required an additional virtual network route to be defined to send the virtual IP traffic to the correct node or cluster.\nThe new Virtual Network Port Forward feature combines the route and port forward configuration and consolidates the definition to the virtual network level.\nLayer 4 Health Checks Deprecated The layer 4 service historically had an option to perform a health check where a connection attempt was made once per minute to the configured IP and port. If this was configured on a cluster, the member nodes would mark themselves unhealthy if the connection failed. Since this was usually caused by an issue with the local network or target server, this frequently led to both nodes being marked as unhealthy and taking the cluster offline. As this feature was rarely used and caused more issues than it solved we have removed this it from this version of the node software. If this was previously configured on a service the setting will be ignored.\nSupport for requiring IMDSv2 on AWS EC2 Instances. The AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides information about the EC2 instance that the Trustgrid service queries to enable certain features. Some potential security issues were identified in the IMDSv1 version of this service and AWS recommends requiring IMDSv2 going forward. This version of the Trustgrid node software is confirmed to be fully compatible with IMDSv2-only instances.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Package Version Core Version Release 1.5.20230712-1762 …","ref":"/release-notes/node/july-2023/","tags":"","title":"July 2023 Appliance Release Notes"},{"body":" Virtual networks define an overlay network and routes for layer 3 connectivity. Trustgrid nodes are then assigned to networks. Virtual network overlays work similarly to Amazon’s VPCs but can span between clouds, data centers, and the edge.\nVirtual Networks Concepts Overlay Example Virtual Networks - Layer 3 Trustgrid uses a virtual network to traffic between nodes. This avoids common challenges like conflicting subnets in large, non-centralized networks.\nInside and outside NATs are used to expose hosts for traffic\nRoutes may be configured on the nodes\nACLs can be applied\nSimple Host Communication An inside Nat on the edge node that maps 10.0.5.250 to 172.16.3.250 would allow the data center host (10.0.1.150) to communicate with 172.16.3.250 host using the address 10.0.5.250\nAn outside Nat on the edge node that maps 10.0.1.150 to 10.0.5.150 would allow the edge host (172.16.3.250) to communicate the data center host at 10.0.5.150.\nA route would have to be added to the default gateway of 172.16.3.0/24 for 10.0.5.150 to route traffic for 10.0.5.0/24 through the gw of the edge node (172.16.0.5) data interface.\nVirtual IP Addresses Through the use of inside and outside NAT rules, local IP addresses to the Trustgrid node may be exposed on the network through a Virtual IP Address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Virtual IP Subnets are also supported where each IP in a subnet is mapped to the corresponding IP in a virtual subnet.\nInside NAT Inside NATs are added to a network to expose hosts in the private network to authorized traffic in the virtual network. For example a host at 192.168.1.184/32 could be exposed as 172.16.1.184/32. Traffic from authorized edge nodes could then communicate with 172.16.1.184.\nOutside NAT The use of an outside NAT can eliminate the need to create routes on internal gateways. Outsides NATs translate address in edge (remote) private networks to a privately addressable local IP. For example a host at 172.16.10.184/32 could be translated to 192.168.1.184/32.\nRoutes Routes are used to specify the network interface to be used when accessing specific subnets.\nVirtual Network Attributes Field Name Description Name A unique name for the network. Can contain letters, numbers and - characters. Network CIDR Network CIDR that includes all desired virtual IP addresses.\nVirtual network defined routes can only point to destination CIDRs within this Network CIDR. This restriction can be overridden by defining routes at the node or cluster VPN \u003e Static routes level. Description A user friendly description of the virtual network NO-NAT Mode Enabled - Nodes attached to the this virtual network will not require traffic match defined inside and outside NATs to allow traffic to ingress from or egress to the local network. Disabled (default) - Nodes attached to this virtual network will require traffic match defined inside and outside NATs to allow traffic to ingress from or egress to the local network. Or, will require the traffic matching mode be set to allow either Inbound or Outbound traffic that does not match.

Change records can now be replicated into a customer’s AWS S3 bucket. This works much like the existing S3 Flow Log Export and requires the same bucket policy and versioning settings. To have this setup contact Trustgrid support. Changes to Container settings now include the name of the container instead of its unique ID. Changes to a policy will now show what resources are covered by the policy. Group deletion is now audited with name. Authentication records using a configured Identity Provider(IdP) now include the IdP used. The advanced search now allows you to select more object types. L4 Proxy UI Improvements This release also makes several improvements to the UI for configuring and managing our Layer 4 (L4) proxy Services and Connectors.\nThese improvement include:\nMore consistency in the names of fields between the add/edit prompt and the table listings. The addition of links to automatically test connectivity of a TCP service and sniff traffic for a connector listening port Removal of the Services Health Check feature. This attribute has been removed from the Add Service prompt and the Services table. Any service that previously had this set to Enabled will continue performing this health check until the service is updated. A future node release will stop performing the health check even if the service is still set to Enabled. Flow Log Advanced Search With this release you can now set the source or destination node to local for an Advanced Flow Log Search. This will cover flows that do not traverse the data plane, such as traffic that is forwarded between interfaces.\nFormatted Slack Alarm Events Previously when an event was forwarded to a Slack Channel it was sent as raw JSON that was difficult to read. There is now an option to format messages sent to Slack to be human readable. Checkbox to enable Slack formatting With this selected message will appear in Slack like the below example.

This should enable us to more tightly integrate the portal UI with related documentation.\nAs a start, we’ve created a link called Documentation under the Management section of the main navigation bar that will open the docs in a new tab.\nAdditionally, we’ve created a section for release notes that will allow you to monitor release for Control Plane and Node releases via RSS feeds going forward.\nSwagger API Documentation Move As part of this change we are moving our API documentation from https://portal.trustgrid.io/api-docs/ to https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/api/. This will allow updating this documentation outside our normal release process.\nCluster Configuration Prior to this release it was necessary to navigate to each member node and configure the cluster heartbeat IP and port after it was added to the cluster. In this release a prompt has been added to the “Add Node” flow that will allow you to configure these settings as part of adding the node to the cluster.\nData Plane Stats This release further improves on our recent addition of data plane telemetry information.\nShow data plane telemetry for offline nodes Show data plane telemetry for connections between public and private gateways Virtual Network Route Table Virtual Network Route Tables can now be sorted by Destination, Destination CIDR or Metric. This can make it much easier to view and understand how routes are configured.\nVirtual Network Routes sorted by destination Container Import Disable Imported Containers Previously, if you imported a container from another node or cluster it was created in the Enabled state. If the container was configured to run as a service this would cause the container to start immediately. This could create issues if additional changes were desired before the container attempts to start, such as creating volumes or adjusting environment variables. With this release the container is imported in a Disabled state and will need to be enabled once you are ready to use the container.\nImport Container Volumes There is a new Action available under Container Management \u003e Volumes to Import. This will enable you to import configured volumes configured on another node or cluster. This will simplify configuring containers that require several volumes to be defined.\n(Note: Just like with container configuration import, the source must match the destination type. A node can import from another node and a cluster can import from another cluster)\nNote: Just like with container configuration import, the source must match the destination type. A node can import from another node and a cluster can import from another cluster Flow Logs Flow Log Ordering Our flow logs have historically been searched starting with the oldest in the time range first. This sometimes forced you to load more results multiple times to see the most current information. With this release we now can search either with oldest or newest first. By default the Flow Logs page will now show the last two hours with the most recent first.\nAdditionally, in the Advanced Search there is a new option to select the Flow Log Order depending on your needs.\nFlow Log Order selector Flow Log S3 Export Previously Trustgrid had a mechanism to export flow logs to an AWS S3 bucket on a nightly basis. This was determined to be insufficient for our customers who wanted closer to real-time access to this data. With this release Trustgrid can configur near real-time S3 to S3 replication with our new Flow Log Export system.\nFlow CSV Export Date Format Trustgrid has long supported the option to export your current view of the Flow Logs to a CSV file. However, the format of dates was difficult to parse using most spreadsheet applications. With this release both the start time and end time (if available) is reported in a human readable format like dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.000 and in Unix Timestamp Milliseconds (MS). This should make analysis of the records much easier and more precise.\nExample CSV export Upgrade Improvements Multi-Node Upgrades Upgrading multiple nodes used to require navigating to each node one at a time, clicking the upgrade button and then entering the node’s name. This prevented accidental upgrades but was difficult for managing large environments. With this release users with the nodes::service:node-upgrade and nodes::upgrade permissions will have the ability to select multiple nodes from the Nodes table and then select “Upgrade” from the “Actions” menu. Multi-Node Upgrade Action Upgrade Status Starting with the node release dated 1.5.20220412-1238 nodes began reporting their upgrade status (In Process, Complete, Failed) to the Trustgrid cloud. With this release this information and the date of the last change in status is displayed in the Info tab of nodes. Upgrade Status section Portal Access Permission With this release there is a new permission portal::access that controls if a user is allowed (or denied) to authenticate into the Trustgrid management portal. This permission was automatically added to all built-in Trustgrid Managed policies, but any custom defined policies that are intended to be used on their own will need to add this permission if management portal access is desired. Portal Access Permission The portal::access must be applied with Resource scope of * to be effective. If using resource scoped policies an additional policy will need to be created and attached to users to grant portal access.

The platform is designed to simplify networking for distributed enterprises by providing a software-defined network (SDN) that operates as a virtual overlay on top of existing networks, enabling organizations to build and manage their own private networks.\nNodes The basic building block of a Trustgrid network is a node. Nodes are deployed on-premises or in your cloud provider and are connected to each other with TLS tunnels. Nodes can be deployed in a variety of ways, including as virtual machines, containers, or bare metal servers.\nNodes are used to enable connectivity and access for different use cases, including:\nZTNA applications, allowing fine-grained network control for access to business applications or servers VPN-like functionality, allowing network address translation (NAT) and routing between nodes Remote container execution, allowing an admin to deploy and manage containers in edge networks FTP (remote or in a data center) and other layer 4 protocols Clusters Nodes can be grouped into clusters to share configuration and provide high-availability.\nVirtual Networks Nodes can be attached to virtual networks, which provide a way to share network configuration like routes, NATs, and ACLs at scale.\nApplications Applications can be exposed through nodes or clusters. Access to an application can be restricted via access policies, for example to only allow users from a specific country.\nManagement All Trustgrid nodes are entirely managed through our control plane:\nSoftware updates are provided through our apt repository that ensures nodes have security updates available and only run with tested software permutations Network, node, user, and application configuration is managed through our web portal Configuration changes are broadcast to nodes as needed, for example when adding routes or adding a gateway to your network ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Concepts Trustgrid is a platform that provides secure, reliable and …","ref":"/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":"\nUser Management Groups defined can be used to make Remote Access applications visible to users.\nThere are two sources for Groups\nTrustgrid-native Groups These groups are created in the portal via the Add Group button.

Our robust networking feature set provides layer 3 and layer 4 network overlays with cloud management tools.\nTypes of Connectivity Trustgrid establishes mutual TLS tunnels between nodes using mutual authentication. These tunnels between edge nodes and gateway nodes constitute the data plane of a Trustgrid network. Over this tunnel two distinct types of connectivity are supported, Layer 3 and Layer 4. Layer 3 supports routed traffic and Network Address Translation (NAT) to replicate traditional WAN connections. Trustgrid’s Layer 4 networking uses reverse proxies to map local IP-port number combinations to remote hosts. Each connectivity type has distinct advantages and may be used for either gateway nodes or edge nodes.\nLayer 3 Overview The Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how edge node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nLayer 3 configuration is required for all Trustgrid networking deployments on the Gateway (data center / cloud) side. This allows the use of L3 or Layer 4 configurations for edge node deployments. Layer 3 connectivity enables easy support of many hosts at each side of the connection. This allows the replication of existing routes and subnets to minimize reconfiguration of any remote or local networks.\nLayer 3 edge configuration is ideal in situations where there is an incomplete understanding of all traffic (source and destination hosts/ports) as it supports more permissive ACLs. It is required when using stateful protocols (except FTP) and other protocols such as SIP.\nAll gateway nodes must be deployed using L3 networking in a two interface (management/data NIC) configuration.\nLayer 4 Overview Trustgrid Layer 4 (L4) is only supported in edge configurations. Layer 4 networking enables a reverse proxy connection between the Gateway Node IP address:port number that maps directly to an on-premise host:port. Specific network plug-ins support stateful features like FTP using L4 connectivity. With Trustgrid’s L4 networks there is no concern of overlapping local IP subnets on either end of the tunnel because Trustgrid proxies the traffic. The source of all TCP/UDP traffic is the edge node interface, not the originating host. This is transparent to the hosts on either side.\nLayer 4 connectivity offers slightly better performance than L3 in specific types of traffic and is ideal when there is a single or few remote/edge hosts that are being accessed with deterministic traffic. Layer 4 edge nodes are usually easier to deploy at an edge site as they can avoid the configuration of a virtual network overlay (NATs, ACLs, Routes, etc). Remote sites that desire to view the actual source of traffic should use Layer 3 for edge configurations as the source IP for all traffic in a Layer 4 connection is the edge node’s data IP address.\n","categories":["overview"],"description":"Trustgrid networking overview\n","excerpt":"Trustgrid networking overview\n","ref":"/getting-started/networking/","tags":["architecture"],"title":"Networking"},{"body":" Operational logs show events related to the functioning of Trustgrid nodes including:\nEvents reported by the node via the control plane including state changes or issues that need investigation.

Certificate based authentication is difficult and requires advanced skill sets. Trustgrid is the ‘root of trust’ in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) built by our security experts to enable automated certificate management across Trustgrid networks. All devices enroll in the PKI and are managed centrally from Trustgrid’s cloud infrastructure. Certificates are issued per device and are used to authenticate, and for encryption of all traffic.\nAuthorization Central to the security of the Trustgrid network is an authorization model derived from Google’s Beyond Corp (aka Zero Trust from Forrester) initiative. This places an implicit deny on all traffic that cannot be configured to allow all traffic. Many breaches have been caused by allowing all traffic to overcome the burden of proper security configuration.\nTrustgrid uses a token to authorize communication between Trustgrid nodes.\nTLS Encryption All data on Trustgrid is encrypted from node to node using next generation encryption – TLS Mutual Authentication. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommends TLS as the replacement to IPSec VPN.\nAutomated Management Trustgird offers tools for automating software updates at scale. A significant difficulty in securing traditional VPNs is the application of patches and updates to hardware appliances. Many vendors own and maintain hundreds or thousands of these devices and are simply unable to efficiently patch them. This leaves significant security vulnerabilities unaddressed in customer and vendor data centers.\nPrivate Data Routing Trustgrid enables private data connections routed on infrastructure owned by each vendor, not through centralized, multi-tenant gateways that touch hundreds of vendors’ connections concurrently.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Trustgrid’s mission is to replace aging Edge connectivity solutions …","ref":"/getting-started/security/","tags":"","title":"Security"},{"body":" Changes to the following configurations are audited: API Cluster Node Domain Certificate Org Profile Invite Audits record the event type (add/remove/change), the user name, the IP address, and the date of the change Audits are kept for 30 days Audits can be downloaded as CSV on the operations page ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Changes to the following configurations are audited: API Cluster Node …","ref":"/help-center/mgmt-logs/config-changes/","tags":"","title":"View Configuration Changes"},{"body":" View node update events on the Operations page Node update events are kept for 30 days You can download a CSV of the node updates from the Operations page All Trustgrid node agent updates and OS package updates are logged ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" View node update events on the Operations page Node update events are …","ref":"/help-center/mgmt-logs/node-update-events/","tags":"","title":"View Node Update Events"},{"body":" For every authentication event, we log: user agent user id user name IP address User authentication events include: Failed login attempts Successful login attempts API interactions Successful sign ups You can download all of the events for a 30 day period in the Operations page Authentication events are kept for 30 days If your organization is utilizing a third-party identity provider via SAML or OpenID, that provider is responsible for providing and storing authentication log records ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" For every authentication event, we log: user agent user id user name …","ref":"/help-center/mgmt-logs/user-authentication/","tags":"","title":"View User Authentication Events"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tags/alarm-filters/","tags":"","title":"alarm filters"},{"body":" Alarm Filters are used to determine which events trigger notifications and to define which channels should receive those notifications.\nAlarm filters have the following fields:\nField Name Description Name The name should be unique. Description The description is displayed in the alarm filters table. Enabled An alarm filter must be enabled for matching event to be sent to the selected channel. Deselecting the check box can be handy if you wish to suppress a specific type of alarm. Channels This section determines which channels matching alarms will be sent to. Criteria The criteria determine which events will match the filter. These conditions can be set as:\nAll (default) - All specified criteria must be true to match. Equivalent to a boolean AND condition. Any - Only one criteria must be true to match. Equivalent to a boolean OR condition. None - The specified criteria must be false to match. Equivalent to a boolean NOT of the criteria ANDed together. Node Name The “Node Name” criteria llows you to select one or more specific node names. Note, even if the filter is set to All, the filter will match any of the selected node names is associated with the event. Event Type The “Event Type” criteria determines which events will match the filter. Note, even if the filter is set to All, the filter will match any of the selected event types. Tag Matches The “Tag Matches” criteria allows you to use tag name/value pairs to determine if the filter should match events. For examples, you may what production devices to send to a high priority channel such as PagerDuty or OpsGenie. If your nodes have a tag to indicating “prod_status=production”, you can select that name/value pair from the list to properly filter your alarms.\nTag Match Any/All You can choose if multiple tags must match ALL or ANY of the selected tag criteria for the filter to match. For example:\nany would cover a scenario where you want to match say Environment=Prod OR Environment=Test. all would cover if you wanted a filter to match something like Environment=Prod AND Region=EAST Severity Each event type has a severity level associated with it. This filter will match any event with the selected severity type or higher. This is the only mandatory criteria.\nThe severity levels are:\nINFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL For example, if you select the severity level of WARNING the filter will match WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL events.\nSome events have a corresponding event that will automatically resolve the alert in the portal and in some channels such as PagerDuty. The corresponding event may have a different severity level, so make sure you select the lower severity for the criteria. e.g. Node Disconnect is a WARNING but Node Connect which resolves it is only INFO. So you’d need to select both Event Types and set the severity to INFO.\nContains Text This field will accept any single string of text to match to the contents of an event. For example, if all your gateways include -gw in the name you could enter that without quotes in the field and it would match any event that includes that text in the event payload. This criteria can also be used if there is another aspect of the node included in the event payload that doesn’t match the criteria above. To see the entire payload of an event configure a less specific payload and send to an email channel to see the JSON.\nThe event payload includes the node’s unique identifier (UID) which is a string of generated text and numbers. If your “Contains Text” criteria is too short, there is a chance a node UID will also match unexpectedly.\nCEL Expression CEL expressions allow logical expressions that evaluate to true or false to determine if a filter should match an alarm. See here for a detailed explanation. CEL Expressions CEL (Common Expression Language) is a simple expression language that allows more complex tests than simple equality checks.\nWhen an alarm filter has a CEL expression set, it will be compiled when saved. If the compilation fails, a validation error will appear at the top of the page.\nCEL expressions allow numerical comparisons, arithmetic, boolean operators, regular expressions, string matching, presence testing and list evaluation.\nEvents are provided inside a ctx object.\n{ \"details\": { \"alertId\": \"40e4a030-440a-4703-b33a-172416da4be2\" }, \"domain\": \"demo.dev.trustgrid.io\",

(e.g. the port is configured for 100 full and the interface negotiates to 100 half) This can lead to performance problems and interface errors until the correct settings are hard set on the interface.\nFrom the Advanced Network Configuration select the Change Interface Speed/Duplex option Select the desired interface from the list. Select the desired speed from the list. Select the desired duplex from the list. Select save to apply the changes. Change Interface MTU By default all interfaces set themselves to the typical MTU size for their environments (1500 for physical, VMware and Hyper-V, 9000 for AWS and Azure). However, if any device between the Trustgrid node and the resources it connects to (both control and data plane) is configured to use a smaller MTU size then this can cause problems.\nTo make the below change permanent it will be necessary to update the interface settings in the Trustgrid portal/api.\nIf the node is rebooted prior to updating this setting the change will be lost. If the node service is restarted a prompt will appear on the interface panel to import and save the current configuration. To change the MTU size of the interface:\nFrom the Advanced Network Configuration select the Change Interface MTU option Select the desired interface from the list. Enter the desired MTU size and select OK to apply the changes.

As part of this process, we will create these additional resources:\nPublic IP for the outside interface. Network Security Group for the outside interface and an explicit Outbound rule for the required connectivity to the Trustgrid Control Plane. Additional rules will need to be added to allow the node to connect to: Outbound rules for data plane gateway IPs and ports if the appliance is acting as an edge/client device Inbound rules if the appliance will be acting as a data plane or ZTNA gateway Network Security Group for the inside interface with no additional rules. After deployment, this security group could be extended to allow for required communication to internal resources.

See the example output in the AZ CLI Example Walkthrough\nGet MAC Address To make Console login easier run the below command to get the outside interface’s MAC address:\naz network nic show --name $name-outside \\ --resource-group $resourceGroup | jq '.macAddress' | \\ sed 's/-/:/g' | tr 'A-F' 'a-f' Example output:\nsales@Azure:~$ az network nic show --name $name-outside \\ --resource-group $resourceGroup | jq '.macAddress' | \\ sed 's/-/:/g' | tr 'A-F' 'a-f' \"00:0d:3a:9d:a3:2d\" Register the VM You can now start the console registration process and if you have portal access complete the activation process.\nAdditional Steps for HA Clusters If deploying an HA cluster there are additional steps required:\nCreate Additional VM Appliance Repeat the steps above to deploy a second VM appliance using different names but in the same resource group and vNet. This will be the secondary node in the HA cluster.\nAssuming you still have the same variables declared from the above deployment you will just need to update the $name variable to a new value like shown in the example below.\nexport name=\"newName\" Then you can proceed with creating the network interface resources and then create the vm appliance.\nCreate Role for Route Management The steps below create a custom role that has permission to manipulate route tables:\nFirst, download the template JSON file to your environment.\ncurl -o tg-route-role.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustgrid/trustgrid-infra-as-code/main/azure/resources/cluster-role-template/tg-route-role.json Use the command below to get your subscription ID:\naz account show --query id -o tsv Use an editor such as vi or nano to modify the template and replace the placeholders REPLACE in the template with your subscription ID.\nOr, you can perform both the above steps in a single command:\nsed -i \"s/REPLACE/$(az account show --query id -o tsv)/g\" tg-route-role.json Optionally, you can edit the Name and Description fields as well.\nThen create the role using:\naz role definition create --role-definition @tg-route-role.json See AZ CLI Example Walkthrough for output.\nThe role created above can only be assigned to resources in the current subscription. If your Azure account topology requires the Trustgrid appliance to be able to manage route tables in other subscriptions you’ll need to create the role in those accounts as well and assign (see below) the role accordingly. Assign Role for Route Management Finally, we need to assign this role. Below are the commands to perform this process without values for the names of the two VMs (vm1 and vm2) for the resource group.\nexport vm1=\"\" export vm2=\"\" export resourceGroup=\"\" export roleName=\"Trustgrid HA Route Role\" export subscription=$(az account show --query id -o tsv) export vm1ID=$(az vm show --name $vm1 --resource-group $resourceGroup --query 'identity.principalId' -o tsv) export vm2ID=$(az vm show --name $vm2 --resource-group $resourceGroup --query 'identity.principalId' -o tsv) export roleID=$(az role definition list --query \"[?roleName=='$roleName'].name | [0]\" -o tsv) az role assignment create --role \"Trustgrid HA Route Role\" --assignee $vm1ID --scope \"/subscriptions/$subscription/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup\" az role assignment create --role \"Trustgrid HA Route Role\" --assignee $vm2ID --scope \"/subscriptions/$subscription/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup\" The above assumes you didn’t change the Name settings in the tg-route-role.json file when creating the role definition. If you did you need to update the roleName variable before exporting. See AZ CLI Example Walkthrough for output. The above commands scope the role to the resource group that contains the node appliance VMs. If your Azure account and resource group topology requires the nodes to be able to update route tables in other resources groups you’ll need to repeat the role assignment commands either at a higher level (like subscription) or with a different value for resourceGroup.

If the device successfully reconnects to the control plane after the select time the user will have the option of importing and saving this new configuration permanently, or reverting to the previous configuration.\nb. If the device does not reconnect within the chosen duration, the device will automatically revert to its previous IP address configuration.\nThe device will revert to the original IP if it is rebooted or power cycled after initiating the “try” option and before importing and saving those changes in the portal.\nChanging Network Adapter 1 - WAN via Try - Detail Process Login to the portal and navigate to the Node that you wish to reconfigure.\nConfirm the node is actively connected to the cloud\nNote: If the device is not online when the below IP change is made it cannot pull this config from the device.

Gateways can be deployed in the same availability zone or different ones to provide greater redundancy across AWS. Deploy a Trustgrid Node AMI in AWS.\nUnder networking \u003e clusters create a cluster using a descriptive and unique name as seen below. Select the cluster that was created and add both gateways to it using the actions drop down button as seen below. Configure the cluster heartbeat on each individual gateway node. This is located under system \u003e cluster. The host should be the gateway interface on which you want to configure the heartbeat. This can be either the WAN facing or LAN facing interface. You can see what IP is configured from the node page under interfaces. The port defaults to TCP 9000 but can be any unused TCP port if desired. Security groups for both gateways will need to allow this communication in both directions. Both gateways send a heartbeat to each other on the configured IP and Port to determine if the other member is healthy. If the secondary is not able to get a response from the primary then it will become the active member of the cluster. Once this has been configured both nodes should show as green and healthy in the cluster as seen below. If deploying gateways in different availability zones then LAN interface routes will need to be added to the cluster for both gateway LAN subnets as seen below. This is to ensure the heartbeat communication is routed over the correct interface instead of going out the WAN interface. Under the cluster \u003e interfaces \u003e eth1 LAN \u003e AWS Route Table Entries add the appropriate CIDR for the edge IP space. This should be the subnet that includes all virtual network IP space configured for edge node sites. For example if you have 100 different edge node sites carved out of 172.16.0.0/16 then you would just add this one CIDR. Once this has been added the route should be created in the routing table that is associated to the gateways LAN interface pointing to the ENI of the active member of the cluster.\nThere is an IAM profile that should have been associated to each gateway outlined in the deployment guide providing them permissions to manage the routes defined in the AWS Route Table Entries. When a failover event occurs an API Call is made to update the route to point to the ENI of the active member of the cluster.\nThis concludes the cluster configuration specifics for AWS deployment.

The virtual IP space is used as a transit network with NAT being utilized to translate IP addresses on to/from the virtual IP space on either side. It is also possible to preserve the original source and destination by having the virtual IP space be identical to the LAN network.\nThe Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between remote networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how local node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nThe following steps illustrate how to configure the Trustgrid VPN feature and will need to be configured on all nodes/clusters that need to communicate across the virtual network.\nCreate the Virtual Network Under Domains -\u003e Domain -\u003e Virtual Networks create the Virtual Network. All gateway/edge nodes deployed and attached to this virtual network will need to be assigned a subnet out of this IP space. It is important to ensure the CIDR created is large enough to encompass all future node deployments. In this example the entire IPV4 space is being used. This IP space is only applicable to the individual virtual network therefore if there are multiple virtual networks there is no overlap or conflict in IP space allocation. Create Routes for the desired Virtual CIDR with the destination being either a single node or a cluster if an HA deployment. Create the appropriate ACL’s if desired for only allowing specific traffic to pass. An ACL is required for any traffic to pass as it is a zero trust model. If traffic is already filtered before reaching the Trustgrid nodes then at minimum an Any:Any rule will need to be created as seen below. Attach Virtual Network to Node / Cluster Select the node or cluster and under vpn attach the virtual network. Define the validation CIDR which should match the route created. NAT rules can only be created within this CIDR. Select the appropriate interface to attach the virtual network to. This can be a physical interface or a virtual vlan interface and should be whichever interface clients will be using as the next hop to reach the remote networks. Configure the appropriate Inside and Outside NATs and then save the configuration. NATs explained in further detail below. Inside NAT: An inside NAT defines how a local device IP address translates into a virtual network address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Or you may want an entire block of local IP addresses to show up on the virtual network as a different block. You can do this translation via Inside NATs. Inside NAT’s also control what local devices can participate on the virtual network. If a local device does not have an inside NAT configured that includes its IP address, it can’t access or be accessed by other devices on the network. To add an inside NAT you must enter the following information:\nLocal CIDR - The local IP address or address block that should be mapped into the virtual network. It should be entered in CIDR block format (eg - 192.168.100.0/24 or 192.168.100.51/32).\nVirtual CIDR - The network IP address or addresses that the local IP addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR block format.\nNote that network addresses map 1x1 with local addresses, so the prefix length (the /xx number of the CIDR) should be the same in both the local and network CIDR blocks of the inside NAT entry.\nOutside NAT: By default, when a device on the local network of a node receives traffic from a remote device on the network, the remote device IP address will be the IP address that was entered in the local CIDR block for the remote node’s inside NAT entry for the remote device. For instance, if the remote device was mapped to network address 10.0.100.1, then its traffic on the local network will appear to come from IP address 10.0.100.1. However due to the local network configuration, there may be some situations where it is desirable to translate remote network addresses before egressing onto the local network. For instance on a local network of 192.168.0.0/16, a user may want the remote devices virtual network IP of 10.0.100.1 to be translated to 192.168.50.5 so that it fits better into the local network setup. This kind of translation can be achieved by adding outside nats. To add an outside NAT you must enter the following information:\nNetwork Group - The network IP address or addresses that should be translated before egressing onto the local network. This should be entered in CIDR block format.\nLocal CIDR - The local IP address or addresses that the network addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR format.\nNote there are situations where it may be desirable to make multiple remote devices masquerade as one local IP address though the use of port address translation (PAT). This can be achieved by defining an outside nat in which the network CIDR contains a larger address space than the local CIDR. For instance, an entry with network CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and local CIDR 192.168.100.10 would make all remote devices with network IP addresses in 10.0.1.0/24 appear as IP address 192.168.100.10 on the local network.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The VPN feature enables routing of IP packets by utilizing a virtual …","ref":"/tutorials/config-l3-vpn/","tags":"","title":"Configure Layer 3 VPN"},{"body":"This describes the process of deploying a WireGuard client which will act as a Trustgrid Edge node connecting to a Trustgrid gateway routing traffic for clients connecting via the WireGuard service.

Two key parameters that control this memory management are the minimum (min) and maximum (max) memory values.\nMinimum Memory: This is the initial memory allocation for the JVM. When your Java application starts, the JVM allocates this amount of memory right away. It’s like setting a base size for the memory footprint of your application.\nMaximum Memory: This is the maximum amount of memory the JVM is allowed to use. If your application needs more memory than the initial amount (set by min), it will continue to use more up to this maximum limit.\nParameter Default Recommendations Minimum 512MB 512MB is the recommended smallest value Maximum 1GB - Start with the total available system memory - Subtract ~ 1G for OS and other processes - If running containers or virtual machines on the appliance subtract their expected memory usage - Set the value so that it does not exceed about 75% of remaining memory Why Increase the Max Memory? Handling Larger Workloads: If your Trustgrid appliance is managing a large number of flows or processing large amounts of data, increasing the maximum memory can help accommodate spikes in memory usage without triggering garbage collection as frequently.\nPerformance Optimization: Increasing the max memory can reduce the frequency of garbage collection (a process that frees up memory by removing unused objects), which can improve performance.\nRemember, while increasing max memory can help, it’s important to balance it with the available system resources to avoid starving other processes or causing system-wide issues.\nJava Garbage Collection The Java Garbage Collection system:\nAutomatically frees up memory by removing unused objects. Essential for managing memory in the JVM. There are multiple different garbage collectors, each with its own strategy and performance characteristics. The default garbage collector on Trustgrid appliances is the Parallel GC. Optionally, we also support using the G1 Garbage Collector.\nSwitching to G1 Garbage Collector Better Performance: G1 offers more predictable garbage collection pauses, reducing latency. Handling Large Memory: Efficient for applications with large heaps. Despite these advantages, Trustgrid has not yet been able to see significant performance improvements by switching to G1 over Parallel GC in most customer environments. Unless you are experiencing specific performance issues, we recommend leaving the default Parallel GC.\nContact Trustgrid support if you need to adjust these settings ","categories":"","description":"Default settings for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running on Trustgrid appliances\n","excerpt":"Default settings for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running on …","ref":"/help-center/kb/default-settings/jvm/","tags":"","title":"Java Virtual Machine (JVM)"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tags/layer-4/","tags":"","title":"layer 4"},{"body":" This security feature allows restricting node functionality to the current public IP address.

How it Works The node will send out packets to each peer’s public IP and port (if a gateway) with incrementing Time To Live (TTL) values. As the packets pass through each router (or hop) along the way the TTL is decreased by one. Any time a router receives a packet with at TTL with the value 1 it will drop the packet and can reply with an ICMP packet saying “Time to Live has been exceeded” The node uses these ICMP packets to calculate latency to each hop. Known Limitations There are several known limitations with gathering this data:\nRouters on the internet are not required to respond with ICMP. This will lead to gaps in the Hop numbers. Those that do respond sometimes deprioritize their response which leads to misleading latency numbers. If you see a hop with high values, but the the values for higher hop numbers is normal this is not likely the cause of problems If a hop has high values and all subsequent hops have higher values this is likely the source of the latency/loss Firewall rules have to allow the packets and the responses. By utilizing the same TCP port as the gateway, all data collected from edge nodes should be allowed out. Some firewalls/routers have trouble correlating the TCP request with the ICMP response which leads to no data Gathering this data requires compute resources on the node and the gateway. Trustgrid recommends only enabling on edge nodes that have frequent latency or packet loss issues as a troubleshooting tool.

Inbound traffic not matching a NAT should be allowed on this interface. Outbound traffic not matching a NAT should be allowed on this interface. Outside NAT Table Used to define outside NATs Inside NAT Table Used to define inside NATs Inside NATs An inside NAT defines how a local device IP address translates into a virtual network address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Or you may want an entire block of local IP addresses to show up on the virtual network as a different block. You can do this translation with an inside NATs. Inside NATs also control what local devices can participate on the virtual network. If a local device does not have an inside NAT configured that includes its IP address, it can’t access or be accessed by other devices on the network. Inside NATs require the following information:\nField Name Description Local CIDR The local IP address or address block that should be mapped into the virtual network. It should be entered in CIDR block format (eg - 192.168.100.0/24 or 192.168.100.51/32). Virtual CIDR The network IP address or addresses that the local IP addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR block format. Network addresses map 1x1 with local addresses, so the prefix length (the /xx number of the CIDR) should be the same in both the local and network CIDR blocks of the inside NAT entry. Outside NATs By default, when a device on the local network of a node receives traffic from a remote device on the network, the remote device IP address will be the IP address that was entered in the local CIDR block for the remote node’s inside NAT entry for the remote device. For instance, if the remote device was mapped to network address 10.0.100.1, then its traffic on the local network will appear to come from IP address 10.0.100.1. However due to the local network configuration, there may be some situations where it is desirable to translate remote network addresses before egressing onto the local network. For instance on a local network of 192.168.0.0/16, a user may want the remote devices virtual network IP of 10.0.100.1 to be translated to 192.168.50.5 so that it fits better into the local network setup. This kind of translation can be achieved by adding outside nats. To add an outside NAT you must enter the following information:\nField Name Description Network Group The network IP address or addresses that should be translated before egressing onto the local network. This should be entered in CIDR block format or as a Network Group. Local CIDR The local IP address or addresses that the network addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR format. An outside NAT is required for all nodes and clusters attached to a virtual network unless the virtual network is in NO-NAT mode. Note there are situations where it may be desirable to make multiple remote devices masquerade as one local IP address though the use of port address translation (PAT). This can be achieved by defining an outside nat in which the network CIDR contains a larger address space than the local CIDR. For instance, an entry with network CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and local CIDR 192.168.100.10 would make all remote devices with network IP addresses in 10.0.1.0/24 appear as IP address 192.168.100.10 on the local network.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" NATs allow Trustgrid to alter the source and/or destination IP …","ref":"/docs/nodes/vpn/nats/","tags":"","title":"Network Address Translation (NATs)"},{"body":"Timeouts The table below details the time the Trustgrid network process waits before terminating a flow.

Determine Connectivity Status of the Trustgrid Node Because Trustgrid provides independent control and data planes, there are a few ways it can manifest as “down”:\nField Name Description Control Plane Down The node appears offline from within the Trustgrid portal. This indicates that the node is disconnected from the control plane either because it has shutdown or has been unable to send a heartbeat notification to Trustgrid within the past 10 minutes. Data Plane Down The node appears online from within the portal but reports it is unable to connect to one or more gateway nodes. This can be indicated by the Data Plane Status indicator when viewing the node in the portal, or by receiving a “Gateway Connectivity Health Check” failure event notification. Both of these only work if the Control Plane is currently working. Both Control and Data Plane Down In this situation the node appears down in the Trustgrid Portal and users/applications are unable to reach services across the data plane between the Gateway and Edge sites. This is the most common scenario. While the Data Plane is most critical for the services provided across the device, first priority should be restoring the Control Plane connection so that additional troubleshooting tools are available. Often this process also uncovers the reason the data plane is down.

When something is not configured correctly, the trustgrid node responds to an ICMP ping with a variety of different “Destination Unreachable” error messages that can indicate what exactly appears to be wrong. Here are the error responses the node may give when attempting to ping a remote machine through the VPN when something is amiss.\nDestination Net Unknown This error means that the node cannot find an interface network binding with an inside and outside nat that match the requests source and destination IP. You should re-examine the inside and outside nats for the node interface that is receiving the packet, and make sure that an inside nat is defined that matches the source machines local IP and an outside nat that matches the virtual destination IP (or that no outside nat is present, which defaults to 1x1).\nDestination Net Unreachable This error means that the node cannot find a route defined at the domain/network level for the destination IP in this request. You should examine the domain route definitions and make sure that one is included for the virtual destination IP address you are trying to ping. Use the View Virtual Route Table tool using the target IP as a filter to confirm the route exists and is available.\nDestination Host Unreachable This error indicates that there is a route defined for the ping dest IP, but that the destination node associated with the route is not currently connected to this node. You should look at the routes in the source node’s detail page in the portal and make sure that there is one included for the destination node that should be receiving the request.\nPacket Filtered This error results when the ping request could not be performed do to the lack of a domain network ACL allowing the request. While this itself only indicates that ICMP traffic is not allowed between these two hosts in this direction, it can be used as a valuable indicator of a bigger policy issue. Check your ACL list in the portal to ensure that icmp are allowed between these to hosts.\nDestination Host Unknown This error happens when the ping packet made it to the destination node, but no set of inside/outside nats could be found that include the source and destination IPs of this request. Check the destination node VPN settings to ensure an inside NAT is present for the virtual destination IP of the request, and either an outside NAT exists and includes the virtual source IP, or no outside NAT is present, which defaults to 1x1.\nNo Ping Response Error When a ping sits there and no response is received, usually the best way to troubleshoot further is to sniff interface traffic with a filter of icmp and host \u003ctarget-ip\u003e on the source and dest nodes.\nWhen troubleshooting, keep in mind that the lack of an error likely means one of the following:\nThe local node VPN interface that should be receiving the packet hasn’t been configured correctly. The local firewall, router or target machine isn’t correctly routing packets to the source node. There is an ARP issue on either the source or destination node where the node isn’t responding correctly (tcpdump -i \u003cdata_nic\u003e arp) There is no responding machine on the remote side!

Policies either allow or explicitly deny specific actions by the user.\nTypes of Policies Trustgrid Managed Policies These policies start with the prefix builtin-tg and are created and managed by Trustgrid to provide a starting level of permissions based on common user types. Descriptions of the user types for each role are listed below.\nAs Trustgrid adds new features or actions theses policies will automatically be updated to include appropriate permissions. These policies cannot be edited by customers.\nCustomer Managed Policies These policies can be defined by customers to meet the specific needs of their teams.\nBest Practices Start by attaching the Trustgrid Managed Policies that best fits the user’s minimum, required needs following the principle of “least privilege.” If additional permissions are required, create a Customer Managed Policy that includes those specific rights rights. Then attach that policy to the user. Trustgrid Managed Policy Descriptions Below are the basic descriptions of the Trustgrid Managed Policies including an example role description. Trustgrid will use this description to guide if it is appropriate to add new permissions to the policies.\nThe policies are listed from lowest permissions to highest.\ntg-builtin-apps-user This policy provides minimal permission for a user to connect to the Trustgrid applications portal for using Remote access apps. The user has no rights within the Trustgrid management portal and should likely be given a landing page of /apps to be redirected straight to the applications portal.\nTarget User: End user for remote access applications with no knowledge of the Trustgrid system.\ntg-builtin-monitor This policy provides read-only access to non-sensitive resources in the Trustgrid management portal.\nTarget User: Project manager or executive sponsor that needs to view information in the portal, but does not require tools required to troubleshoot or resolve issues.\ntg-builtin-operator This policy provides mostly read-only access but also has the ability to view and use tools within the portal and perform actions to resolve common issues (e.g. restarting/rebooting nodes).\nTarget User: Entry level technical resources responsible for initial triage of support issues.\ntg-builtin-node-admin This policy provides the ability to make changes to most resources but is restricted from making changes that can have a wide impact such as changing a gateway node server settings.\nTarget User: Mid-level technical resources that need to make changes to things like node VPN configuration and virtual networks routes, but should be restricted from making changes that can impact an entire organization when possible.\ntg-builtin-admin This policy has permissions to change almost all resources with the exceptions of Identity Providers and User Management.\nTarget User: Senior technical resources needing near full access.\ntg-builtin-access-admin This policy grants the ability to manage permissions and identity related resources including configuring Identity Providers, Add/Inviting Users, and creating and assigning policies\nTarget User: Management or access control related resources responsible for granting access to the Trustgrid system.\nResource-Scoped Policies Policies have a Resources section that allow the permissions granted to be limited to specific Trustgrid resources, such as nodes and clusters. This can be used to present a user with an extremely limited view in the portal. For example, an edge site technical contact could be given a login that was only permitted to see the nodes at their site.\nIn order to grant users access to the portal a second policy is required granting the portal::access permission to the * resource. Trustgrid Resource Names or TGRN Trustgrid has adopted a resource naming convention that follows the basic format: tgrn:tg::\u003cservice\u003e:\u003cresource-type\u003e/\u003cresource-id\u003e\nWildcard TGRN By default the Resources field is populated with * which grants permissions to all resources. This is included by default for new policies and would need to be removed to provide TGRN restricted permissions.\nNode TGRN A node’s TGRN will start with the below prefix: tgrn:tg::nodes:node/ To get the node’s complete TGRN you’ll need to append the node ID which is visible by navigating to the node and either copying from the URL or using the Node ID field in the Info visor drop down\nA complete node TGRN looks like: tgrn:tg::nodes:node/ab3550cf-f3da-4d90-b4b1-b870fc85c9c7\nCluster TGRN Cluster TGRN start with the prefix: tgrn:tg::nodes:cluster/ This is followed by the cluster’s fully qualified domain name (fqdn) which is the combination of the cluster name and your organizations trustgrid domain. This visible in the URL when you navigate to a cluster in the portal.\nA complete cluster TGRN looks like: tgrn:tg::nodes:cluster/awscluster.training.trustgrid.io\nPolicy Management Creating/Editing Policies Navigate to User Management → Policies For a new policy click Create Policy. To edit an existing find it in the list and click on its name. The policy wizard has two sections. The left section groups permissions by category and is where you allow or deny permissions. The right section shows the resulting JSON of the policy and is read only. As an example we will create a role to grant users the ability to see, edit and comment on Provisioning orders. a. Under Permissions, search for orders b. Click the green check box next to each of the desired permissions. (Clicking the X would explicitly deny that permission which will take precedent over any other policy that allows that permission) c. You will notice the Policy JSON updated as you select permissions d.

Overview The remote console registration process allows for a Trustgrid Node running a generic image to be registered with a valid Trustgrid account.\nRequirements Console access to the Trustgrid Node. This could be achieved via: For physical devices either keyboard and monitor connections or serial console For VMware or Hyper-V remote console access For Azure and AWS serial console access via each providers management portal Portal access with the appropriate permissions to activate nodes. Note: It is not necessary for a single person to have both console and portal access. This would allows a Trustgrid customer to ship their clients a generically imaged device or access to a virtual machine image.\nOnce the node is deployed with the required network access the Trustgrid customer can work together with their client to complete the activation process.\nHigh-Level Process The user with console access to a Trustgrid node logs in: If necessary they can configure a static IP address from the console. They then initiate the registration process. This triggers a process that generates unique certificates for the node, upgrades to the latest version, and generates a short activation code. The node will then begin checking with the Trustgrid control plane to see if it has been activated. This code can then be shared with a user with access to the Trustgrid portal. That user can then enter the code in the Trustgrid portal via the Activate Node action. After entering the code they are prompted to provide a name for the node and click License Node. When the node detects its code has been activated it finalizes registration and then reboots. The node is then available for use and configuration. Registering a Node Generating Activation Code from Console Gain console access Login as tgadmin (Optional) Use the Network Configuration Option to change the IP. Default is to use DHCP.

Remote Registration Menu option You will be prompted to confirm the make and model of the node and the correct control plane endpoints to register with. These should default to the correct settings for your model, if not work with Trustgrid Support. Confirm Options The node will then generate a unique activation code. This code can be shared with a user with access to the Trustgrid portal. Example registration code Portal Activation Process Currently only users that have been granted access to this feature will see the action to activate a node.\nThe user with access to the Trustgrid portal logs in and navigates to the Nodes page.

Entering the Activate Code Enter a name for the node and click License Node. Node information and prompt for name The portal will display a message indicating the node has been activated. Activation notice The node will complete the registration process and reboot. The node will then be available for use and configuration. Registered node listed in Nodes table Console view after the registered nodes has rebooted. Deregistering a Node In rare circumstances a node may need to be deregistered which will remove the link between it and the account it was registered with. This will not remove the node from the Trustgrid control plane but communication with both the Trustgrid control plane and any data plane gateways will be severed. This is a one-way process and the node will need to be re-registered with the Trustgrid control plane to re-establish communication.\nThis process does not completely reset the device to its initial image state, but should be suitable for redeploying at the same site. Deregistration Process Gain console access Login as tgadmin Select the Deregister Node action from the main menu. Deregister Menu When prompted confirm you wish to deregister the node. Deregister Confirmation You will then be prompted to enter DEREGISTER to confirm. Second deregister Confirmation The node will then: If the node is currently connected to the Trustgrid control plane it will send a “Deregister” event type and disconnect from the control plane and any data plane gateways. Deregister event Remove it’s local certificates and reset it self to be ready to re-register. Pre-registration Utilities Before the node is registered there are a number of utilities available to assist with configuration and troubleshooting.\nNetwork Configuration Utility This utility is useful for switching the node to use a static IP or back to DHCP.

Failing Back To send traffic back to the primary site reverse the changes in the routing performed during the failover.\nAutomatic Failover When a customer has selected automatic failover between sites there should be no intervention required if the primary site goes offline. The route table will be configured with multiple routes with different metrics. When determining where to send virtual traffic a node will select:\nThe most specific route - meaning if there is a route for 192.168.100.1/32 and another for 192.168.100.0/24, the /32 route will be preferred With the lowest metric that is currently available - meaning this node has an active tunnel to the destination node/cluster Below reflects a typical automatic failover configuration for a network\nForcing Failover or Prevent Auto-Failback If it is necessary to move traffic to the secondary site without the primary site going offline follow the below process.\nAlso, if a failure of the primary site has occurred and you want to ensure traffic does not automatically return to that site if it comes online (e.g. it is unstable) you can follow the same process.\nIn the portal, navigate to Domain → Virtual Networks and then select the appropriate Virtual network.\nSelect Routes from the left navigation bar.\nFilter the route table either using the node/cluster names or network to be failed over (shown below)\na. If there is more than one network that needs to be routed to the secondary site using node/cluster names to filter is more efficient Adjust the metric so that the primary site is a higher number than the secondary site. The maximum metric value is 200. Click Save and navigate to Review Changes\nYou should see a change like below for each route adjusted. Click Apply Changes if all looks correct.\nIt may take 1-2 minutes for nodes to pull down the updated route table. At that point, they will route new flows/connections to the new destination.\nBecause the primary site is still online, you will need to restart the active node at that site to clear out any existing flows/connections.\na. If it’s a cluster, navigate to the cluster and then select the currently active node from the overview page. If a single node site, navigate directly to that node.\nb. From the toolbar select Restart\nc. Enter the node’s name and click confirm\nRestore Traffic to Primary Site To restore traffic to the primary site repeat the above steps but set the route for the primary site to have the lowest metric.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" The below processes should be used to move traffic between sites in …","ref":"/tutorials/operations-runbook/site-failover/","tags":["failover","help","troubleshoot"],"title":"Site Failover"},{"body":" The sniff interface traffic tool performs a traffic capture on the selected node, which can help troubleshoot connectivity issues.\nSummary The Sniff Interface Traffic tool allows you to monitor traffic in real-time but there are certain instances where you need to be able to capture traffic to a file for further analysis. For example, intermittent issues may require leaving a capture running for an unknown period of time. Or, perhaps you need to review the application data within the packet payload.\nThe Traffic Capture is started with a standard tcpdump filter, just like the sniff interface tool, and max capture file size. Once the capture is stopped the captured data is written to .pcap files which can then be transferred for review.\nThe pcap files will include the data payload of any communication captured. If a non-encrypted protocol (such as HTTP or FTP) is used this could be visible in clear text. Because of the risk of data being visible, there are several restrictions and controls in place:\nThe permission to run this tool (node-advanced::service:tg-capture) must be granted on a per-user basis. Not even administrators have this feature by default. Trustgrid employees are specifically denied the ability to run this tool. Trustgrid employees are not permitted to view data transferred through our devices, so please do not send us the resulting pcap files. Accessing \u0026 Using Sniff Interface Traffic Login to the Trustgrid portal and navigate to the Node from which you want to capture traffic.\nSelect Interfaces under the Network section.\nClick the Sniff Traffic button\nSet the appropriate parameters.\niface The interface name filter The tool utilizes TCPDump filtering syntax, which can help isolate interesting traffic. The below filter would show only ICMP and TCP traffic Click Execute to view the captured traffic\nTransfer PCAP Files Now that you have created the pcap files you will need to transfer them somewhere for analysis. The Trustgrid node has standard file transfer clients installed including scp, sftp, and ftp.\nOn a Local Network If the destination file server is on the local network of the node you will use the standard Terminal tool to run the file transfer commands.\nNavigate to the node Open a terminal from the toolbar at the top right You will need to ensure that:\nThe node has a valid route to the destination server’s network Any firewall between the node and destination server allows the traffic The destination server is configured to allow the node IP to connect Once you are in the terminal with the above configured an example scp command would look something like scp ~/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap0 username@172.16.100.10:/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap.\nAcross the Virtual Network If the destination file server is across a Trustgrid virtual network you will need to use the VPN Admin terminal to run the file transfer commands. This uses the nodes configured Virtual Management IP to communicate to remote resources.\nNavigate to the node\nSelect the VPN panel. You may need to select the virtual network to use, if your device is connected to multiple.\nSelect the Admin Terminal button from the tools dropdown.\nYou will need to ensure that:\nThe node has a virtual management IP assigned. The tool will not launch without this. A route for the virtual management IP exists in the virtual network route table. On the destination node, that a 1:1 NAT exists for the destination file server assigning it to a virtual IP. A route that includes the destination file server’s VIP exists in the network route table. A virtual network access policy exists that allows the source node’s virtual management IP to connect to the destination file server’s VIP on the required port for your protocol. The destination side node has a valid route to the destination server’s network. Any firewall between the node and destination server allows the traffic. The destination is configured to allow the node IP to connect. Once you are in the admin terminal with the above configured, an example SCP command would look like scp ~/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap0 username@10.200.100.10:/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap.\nUseful Filters The below filters can be combined using “and” \u0026 “or” without quotes\nYou can filter based on protocol such as “tcp”, “udp”, or “icmp” without quotes Best practice is to filter for what you want to see rather than filter out what you don’t want to see To see only traffic for a specific host use “host x.x.x.x” with the IP address in place of the x.x.x.x To see only traffic for a specific port use “port XXXX” replacing the XXXX with the desired port number If capturing traffic on a clustered node, you should filter out the cluster port traffic. Typically port 9000 or 1975. E.g., not port 9000 If capturing on the ETH0 - WAN Interface, you should filter out traffic to both Trustgrid’s network (35.171.100.16/28) and your data plane gateways’ network or public IP. You’ll need to identify the actual network or IPs. E.g., not net 35.171.100.16/28 and not net X.X.X.X/X or not net 35.171.100.16/28 and not host X.X.X.X.

It helps identify issues and proactively address network problems before they impact users. This monitoring can go beyond Trustgrid’s native hop monitoring to perform additional tests. For organizations already using ThousandEyes this can provide a single pane of glass view of network performance.\nThis guide walks through how to download the latest published container, push it to the private Trustgrid container repository for your organization and then configure an Trustgrid node or cluster to run the container.\nPrerequisites You will need an existing ThousandEyes account Within this account you will need to generate an account token to be used in the deployment of the containers. The host node will need sufficient resources to run the container including: 1.5-2GB of free RAM under normal operating conditions 3-5GB of free Disk Space CPU use will depend on the number of test being performed but as a general recommendation a 2-core machine that operates under 40% CPU utilization under normal conditions should be suitable The container will use the host node’s WAN IP information to connect to the ThousandEyes cloud. If behind a firewall ensure you follow ThousandEyes recommended firewall configuration. Additionally the container regularly attempt to upgrade its base Ubuntu packages via the public Canonical APT repositories via port 80. There does not appear to be a static list of IPs for these repositories. The container will run without but will log frequent warnings about failed upgrades. Trustgrid recommends running this container on node running versions newer than package version 1.5.20230302-1595 Note: ThousandEyes support does not officially support running their agent container on Trustgrid nodes because Trustgrid (like many other edge compute platforms) does not utilize the Docker runtime to run and manage containers. However, Trustgrid has successfully deployed and run this container in several environments. Container Image Management There are two ways that the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent container published at hub.docker.com can be pulled down by a Trustgrid node to execute.\nPull Directly from hub.docker.com In this method, the Trustgrid node will attempt to connect directly to hub.docker.com.\nPros:\nQuick and easy to setup Cons:\nRequires all nodes to have port 443 access to hub.docker.com. This can be a challenge in highly secure environments. Limited ability to control the actual image being run. For example, if you utilize thousandeyes/enterprise-agent:latest, then any time a new version is pushed up with that tag the nodes will pull an updated version that you may not have tested. Pull from private Trustgrid repository Every customer organization is given a namespace in a private container repository hosted in the Trustgrid control plane, which nodes should already have access to. In this method, you first pull down the image to a system with docker running, log into your organization’s custom repository, tag the image in the correct namespace, and push the image back up.\nPros:\nMore secure. Provides control over what image is available and used. Cons:\nRequires a third device with docker running to pull/tag/push the image. Process (Optional) Push Container Image to Trustgrid Repository The steps below need to be performed on a machine with Docker installed and running. In the below :latest can be replaced by a specific version tag if desired. Login to your organization’s private repository. run the command docker pull thousandeyes/enterprise-agent:latest run the command docker tag thousandeyes/enterprise-agent:latest docker.trustgrid.io/\u003corgname\u003e.trustgrid.io/thousandeyes-enterprise-agent:latest being sure to replace \u003corgname\u003e with your organization’s Trustgrid domain. run the command docker push docker.trustgrid.io/\u003corgname\u003e.trustgrid.io/thousandeyes-enterprise-agent:latest Create Required Volumes The ThousandEyes container requires three persistent volumes.\nIn the Trustgrid portal navigate to the node or cluster where you want to run the containers. Select the Container Management → Volumes panel. Use the Add Volume button to create the three volumes listed below. te-agent-lib te-agent-logs te-browserbot-lib Configure the Container Navigate to Container Management → Containers\nCreate the Container Click Add Container Give the container a name Leave Execution Type as “On Demand” Select the image If you followed the above process to push the image to your private repository: From the image drop down select the image you pushed to the Trustgrid repository above. \u003corgname\u003e.trustgrid.io/thousandeyes-enterprise-agent From the tag drop down select latest (or the version tag you applied) If you chose to pull directly from hub.docker.com: Enter thousandeyes/enterprise-agent in the image section Leave latest in the tag field unless you want to specify a different version tag published Click Save In the Containers table, click the link to open the properties of the newly defined container and proceed to the steps below to complete the configuration Configure Environmental Variables In the Environmental Variables Section\nAdd a variable named TEAGENT_ACCOUNT_TOKEN The value will need to be the account group token generated within your ThousandEyes portal Add a variable named TEAGENT_INET with a value of 4 (Optional) the HOSTNAME variable can be defined to determine the name used to register the agent in the ThousandEyes system. By default it will register using the the hostname of the Trustgrid node.\nEnvironmental Variables Add Volume Mounts You will need to add the following Mounts to the container.\nType Source Destination Volume te-agent-lib /var/lib/te-agent Volume te-agent-logs /var/log/agent Volume te-browserbot-lib /var/lib/te-browserbot Click Add Entry Select Volume as the type Select the Source Volume you created earlier Copy and paste the destination from the table above Click the green arrow to save the entry Repeat with the other two mounts Click the Save button\nVolume Mounts Set Resource Limits Resource Limits are intended to reduce the risk of the container consuming CPU, Memory or IO resources to the point they impact other services on the node such as VPN traffic. The below settings are based on the resource available on a dual core device with 4GB of total memory with no other containers running and moderate levels of VPN traffic. Other device types may warrant different settings Enter 40 for the CPU Max % Enter 1536 for the Memory Max (granting up to 1.5G of RAM) Enter 1024 for the Memory High (this will attempt to limit the container to 1G of RAM) Leave the IO and Limits settings blank. Click Save Resource Limits for a device with 4G of available memory Linux Capabilities The ThousandEyes Agent container needs the NET_ADMIN and SYS_ADMIN capabilities to function as expected.\nClick Add Entry From the list select NET_ADMIN and click the green checkbox to save Repeat to add SYS_ADMIN Click the Save button Test Container Functionality On Demand containers only run when specifically started via the Trustgrid control plane. This is idea for testing the configuration before setting the containers to run as a service\nNavigate to the new container’s Overview page If the container was defined at the Cluster level, navigate to one of the member nodes’ Container Management → Containers page and click on the container. Usually best to start with the standby member if the cluster is in production Click the “Start” button A new window should pop-up (if not check to see if you browser is blocking pop-ups). The container will: The first time the container is run it will download the container image. The ThousandEyes agent container is ~1.2G at this time so it can take a while depending on available. Subsequent starts will only check to see if new layers are available. Start the container and display the standard output After the container has started, log into your ThousandEyes account and confirm you see the Enterprise Agent listed. Stop the running container by clicking the Terminate button. (Optionally) If working with a cluster repeat the above with the steps with the other cluster member. Set the Container to Service Once satisfied the containers are running as expected you’ll want to set the container to run as a Service so that it stays running at all times\nNavigate to Container Management → Containers and select the ThousandEyes container If dealing with clustered nodes do this from the Cluster page On the Overview page change the Execution Type from “On Demand” to “Service Click Save After a minute or two you should be able to click the Logs button to confirm the container started ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Description Running the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent from remote …","ref":"/tutorials/containers/thousand-eyes/","tags":"","title":"Deploying ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent Container on Trustgrid"},{"body":" Thresholds provide a way to trigger events when different measurements exceed a given value.

For example the password for the device pictured below would be 00:08:a2:0b:cd:30 all lowercase.\nUpon successful login you will see the Network Status page shown below. This shows the current connectivity status of various Trustgrid services. Green means connectivity is established and red means it is not. Select Management Interface (shown below) on the left hand side of page. You can then edit the IP Address/Netmask/Gateway and DNS Servers configured. Once the relevant changes have been made click on Apply and then click Save. Check the network status page to see if the Trustgrid services turn green. If they do then cable the node back as expected.\nContact Trustgrid support and communicate the IP information configured above so they can update the configuration in the portal and enable the node.\nIf the old IP information remains in the portal the device may revert the local configuration requiring a repeat of the above process.

All changes in this panel require either the builtin-tg-acess-admin policy or similar permissions.\nAdding or Inviting Users Users can either be invited to the Trustgrid portal and utilize Trustgrid’s native authentication system, or be added and be authenticated by a customer configured Identity Provider (IdP).\nInviting Users For users that will utilize Trustgrid’s native authentication system, you will need to invite them with a valid email address.\nNavigate to User Management → Users Under Actions select Invite User Invite User action Enter the user’s valid email address and select the desired base policy (more can be attached later). Click Send Invite. You should see a confirmation that the invite was sent like the one below. The user will receive an email with a link to the Trustgrid Portal or similar. They will need to click said link. Once at the Portal, the user will need to click the Sign Up option. The user must use the same email address that was invited to get access to your account. User Sign Up page After filling out the required information and clicking Sign Up they will be prompted to configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Trustgrid recommends using a one-time password MFA such as Authy or Google Authenticator. Scan the QR code with your app. Enter the passcode and click the \u003e. You’ll be provided with a recovery code. Save this in a secure place, confirm it is safely recorded and click the \u003e. Adding Users (with Identity Providers) If your account has an Identity Provider (IdP) configured as a Portal Auth Provider, you use the Add User button to create an identity for them within Trustgrid.\nSome IdP’s allow for users to be synchronized automatically making this step unnecessary Navigate to User Management → Users Click the Add User button Enter in the user’s email address. This must be the same email address the IdP sends back to Trustgrid, if unsure consult with your IdP Admin. Select your Identity Provider (if more than one) Select the desired base policy. More can be attached later. Click Save Add User Prompt The user can then navigate to the portal authentication domain associated with the IdP. They will be redirected to the IdP page and required to enter their username, password and MFA (if configured), then automatically sent back to the Trustgrid portal.
