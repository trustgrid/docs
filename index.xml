They can be used to troubleshoot connectivity issues, or to monitor traffic patterns.
What are flow logs? Flow logs are records containing metadata about each network traffic flow, or conversation, from the initial connection (e.g. the first SYN packet for TCP) to the closing of the connection (e.g. FIN or RST packets for TCP). Flow logs do not contain any payload data for the flow which makes them much smaller and more secure than a full packet capture of the same flow.</description></item><item><title>Configure Subnet Routing</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/getting-started/trial/subnet-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/getting-started/trial/subnet-routing/</guid><description>The tutorial up to this point only demonstrated the ability to send traffic between the IP addresses assigned to the trustgrid0 interfaces on each agent. However, it&amp;rsquo;s quite likely that security and operational constraints will prevent the Trustgrid agent from being installed directly on the target server. Instead, the agent will need to route traffic destined for the target server&amp;rsquo;s local network.
In this section, we will configure an agent to route traffic destined for another network through the Trustgrid virtual network.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading Trustgrid Appliance Nodes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/upgrade-nodes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/upgrade-nodes/</guid><description>How an Appliance Node Upgrades The upgrade process will:

There is no attachment of the vnet interface to a node interface required but the virtual network does need to be attached to the node or cluster before the tunnel interface is created.</description></item><item><title>Volumes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/containers/volumes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/containers/volumes/</guid><description>Volumes allow containers to persist data between executions.
