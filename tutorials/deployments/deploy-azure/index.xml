When failover occurs, the floating IP address will automatically be assigned to the active appliance in the cluster. This feature works by creating a new Azure IP Configuration and associating it with the interface of the active cluster node.
Graceful Failover This describes the process of a graceful failover when the active member of the node is changed but both members are online and working normally.</description></item><item><title>Azure Route Failover</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/deployments/deploy-azure/route-failover/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/deployments/deploy-azure/route-failover/</guid><description>How it works Trustgrid provides the ability for a cluster of Azure based appliances to published routes to one or more Azure route table. When failover occurs, the Trustgrid appliance will automatically update the next hop IP address in the route table to the active appliance in the cluster.
