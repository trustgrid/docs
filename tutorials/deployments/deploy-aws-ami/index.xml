Only the active member of the Trustgrid Cluster will respond as healthy to the health check.
Create NLB (Network Load Balancer) with listener set to configured UDP wireguard server port (Default 51820) and forwarding to the target group created above.</description></item><item><title>Configure HA Trustgrid Gateway Cluster in AWS</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/deployments/deploy-aws-ami/configure-ha-gateway-cluster-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/deployments/deploy-aws-ami/configure-ha-gateway-cluster-in-aws/</guid><description>Deploy a pair of Trustgrid gateways. Deployment guide includes an example Cloud Formation template that can be used directly or customized for your environment or converted to Terraform if preferred. Gateways can be deployed in the same availability zone or different ones to provide greater redundancy across AWS. Deploy a Trustgrid Node AMI in AWS.
Under networking &amp;gt; clusters create a cluster using a descriptive and unique name as seen below.</description></item></channel></rss>
