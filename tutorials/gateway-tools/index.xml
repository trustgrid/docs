Network hop monitoring requires version 20220808 or newer to gather the required data. How it Works The node will send out packets to each peer&amp;rsquo;s public IP and port (if a gateway) with incrementing Time To Live (TTL) values. As the packets pass through each router (or hop) along the way the TTL is decreased by one.</description></item><item><title>Ping Remote Node</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/gateway-tools/ping-remote-node/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/gateway-tools/ping-remote-node/</guid><description>This tool runs a ping from the gateway node to a remote edge node to verify the Trustgrid overlay network is functioning as expected.
Usage Navigate to the node from which you want to test connectivity.
Click the Data Plane link on the left hand side.
Among the gateways (in the case of an edge node) or edge nodes (in the case of a gateway), click Ping on the row of the node you want to test.</description></item></channel></rss>
