Running diag Command Connect to the machine with the Trustgrid agent installed and open a console. If running as a container you will need to use the appropriate tools to get command line interface (cli) inside the container not the host. Run the command tg-agent diag Review the output tg-agent diag -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- DNS ------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- keymaster.</description></item><item><title>Viewing Agent Debug Logs</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/debug-logs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/debug-logs/</guid><description>The Trustgrid agent generates debug logs that can be useful for troubleshooting issues. Many log entries are fairly self explanatory, but some may require the assistance to Trustgrid support to fully understand their context.
Viewing Debug Logs Viewing Log Files The agent log files are located in /var/log/trustgrid/agent. The active log file is tg-agent.log. Logs rotate every day, with the last 9 days kept in separate files appended with a number.</description></item><item><title>Restart Agent Node Service</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/restart-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/restart-agent/</guid><description>Restarting the agent service is sometimes necessary to reload configuration changes or restart the agent process. The steps to restart the agent service depends on the operating system.
Restarting the agent service will disrupt traffic across the node. Restarting Linux Agent Restart Ubuntu Agents Gain console access to the agent host system via SSH or local console with a user with sudo access to run the below commands. Run the command sudo systemctl restart tg-agent Copy</description></item><item><title>Upgrade Trustgrid Agent Nodes</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/upgrade-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/management-tasks/agent-mgmt/upgrade-agent/</guid><description>How an Agent Node Upgrades The Trustgrid agent upgrade process will depend on the operating system the agent runs on. For the most part the process will include:
Gaining console access to the agent host system either via SSH or local console Running a package management tool to update the agent software package Restarting the agent service if not done automatically by the package manager Restarting the agent service is important to ensure it loads the latest configuration and starts with the updated code but will disrupt traffic across the node.</description></item></channel></rss>
