A cluster is a pair of nodes at a single site that share some configurations and provide automatic failover. An additional IP address is assigned as a Cluster Virtual IP address that can move between the nodes if failover occurs.
Certain settings such as network services and VPN settings can be configured for the cluster and these settings will override the individual node&amp;rsquo;s configuration.</description></item><item><title>Cluster Failover Response</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/operations-runbook/cluster-failover-response/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/tutorials/operations-runbook/cluster-failover-response/</guid><description>When the active (master) member of the cluster goes unhealthy the standby member will take over the active role. This process should be automatic and not require manual intervention. However, in certain circumstances, such as the unexpected failover of a public gateway, it is worth investigating to confirm traffic is in a healthy state.
