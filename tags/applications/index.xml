Trustgrid provides several ZTNA application types that allow remote access to internal resources through a continuously validated connection.
Each application has an Access Policy and a Visibility list. For a user to connect to a ZTNA application, they must (1) be permitted access by the application&amp;rsquo;s Access Policy and (2) be able to see the application.</description></item><item><title>Access Policy</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/access-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/access-policy/</guid><description>An Access Policy is comprised of several rules that determine whether a user is permitted to access a ZTNA application. If no rule matches a user&amp;rsquo;s access attempt, the attempt will be denied.
Each rule has three types of criteria:
Field Name Description Include criteria in this section are logically OR&amp;rsquo;d together. For a rule to apply to an access attempt, at least one of the include criteria must match.</description></item><item><title>RDP App</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/rdp-app/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/rdp-app/</guid><description>A RDP app is a ZTNA application that allows remote access to an internal RDP server.

This allows a user to access any URL on the internet through a ZTNA application, but only if the URL is explicitly allowed by the application.
This can be used to permit readonly or certain operations remotely, but still require local access for more sensitive operations.</description></item><item><title>Visibility</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/visibility/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/applications/visibility/</guid><description>Visibility groups determine what applications a user can see on their application dashboard.
