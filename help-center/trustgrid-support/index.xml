&lt;p>To prevent unauthorized users from potentially compromising the control plane, Trustgrid has implemented a policy to approve customers&amp;rsquo; staff for access to technical support services. Trustgrid will not refuse support completely in cases when unauthorized staff request it, but will limit the disclosure of confidential information and will refuse to make configuration changes without approval from an authorized support contact.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All staff who request support must have a portal login.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Trustgrid support staff will not execute any change requested by staff that exceeds that staff members access to portal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Monitor Access: Staff can alert of issues and request remote assistance but no change in the portal can be requested or made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b. Operator Access: Staff can alert of issues and request remote assistance but only changes limited to the Operator role can be requested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c. Administrator Access: Staff can request any system change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
