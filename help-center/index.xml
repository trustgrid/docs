They can be used to troubleshoot connectivity issues, or to monitor traffic patterns.
What are flow logs? Flow logs are records containing metadata about each network traffic flow, or conversation, from the initial connection (e.g. the first SYN packet for TCP) to the closing of the connection (e.g. FIN or RST packets for TCP). Flow logs do not contain any payload data for the flow which makes them much smaller and more secure than a full packet capture of the same flow.</description></item><item><title>Check Trustgrid Services Status</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/trustgrid-service-status/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/trustgrid-service-status/</guid><description>View the status of all Trustgrid services on our Statuspage Account
