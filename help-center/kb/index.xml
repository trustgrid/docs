Nodes create tunnels to other nodes for data transfer, and to the management infrastructure for control. All tunnels are TLS connections and must be permitted by any firewall between
Network Requirements for All Nodes In order to connect to the Trustgrid Control Plane, the following outbound traffic must be allowed from the node’s configured primary interface IP address</description></item><item><title>WAN/ISP Redundancy Configurations</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/kb/wan-redunancy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/kb/wan-redunancy/</guid><description>The sections below provide examples of how Trustgrid nodes can be deployed to provide WAN/ISP redundancy Behind Firewall/Router with Multiple ISP Connections In this configuration the Trustgrid WAN interfaces are behind a firewall or router that has two independent ISP connections to provide internet access.
The firewall or router is responsible for either failing over outbound traffic in the event of an ISP failure, or to route different nodes to utilize specific ISP connections.</description></item></channel></rss>
