The firewall or router is responsible for either failing over outbound traffic in the event of an ISP failure, or to route different nodes to utilize specific ISP connections.</description></item><item><title>Site Requirements</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/kb/site-requirements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/help-center/kb/site-requirements/</guid><description>Trustgrid’s architecture consists of Nodes deployed at the Edge (on-premise) and management infrastructure built in AWS. Nodes create tunnels to other nodes for data transfer, and to the management infrastructure for control. All tunnels are TLS connections and must be permitted by any firewall between
Recommendations At least 10 Mbps download speed is recommended for reasonable performance during upgrades. Actual bandwidth requirement will be specific to the workloads running across the device.</description></item></channel></rss>
