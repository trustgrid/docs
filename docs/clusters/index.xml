The Trustgrid control plane can monitor the member nodes and generate events when their state changes such that the health of the cluster is impacted.
Basics These events are based on the information reported by each member node to the control plane. Because of this:
There can be a delay between a change and the Cluster Site Health events.</description></item><item><title>Cluster-Only Configuration Items</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/clusters/cluster-only-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/clusters/cluster-only-config/</guid><description>Cluster IP The Cluster IP is a virtual IP address used by the cluster to provide a consistent endpoint for clients, even when the active node changes.
Availability Platform Supported On-Premise ✅ Yes Azure ✅ Yes AWS ❌ No Google Cloud (GCP) ❌ No On-Premise The Cluster IP is supported in on-premise deployments. The active member of the cluster answers ARP requests for the Cluster IP.
