A GRE tunnel interface is created which can then be attached to an interface on a node. VRFs can then be used to control the flow of traffic and how it should appear on the network.

Once an IPSec tunnel is configured an IPSec virtual interface is created that can be attached to a node interface. VRFs can be used in conjunction to explicitly control what traffic is allowed (VRF ACLs) to pass and how it should look on the network (VRF NATs or Traffic Rules).</description></item><item><title>VNET</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/tunnels/vnet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/tunnels/vnet/</guid><description>A virtual network tunnel interface can be configured on a Trustgrid node or cluster to allow the forwarding of traffic to a remote Trustgrid Node or Cluster that is attached to the same virtual network. The tunnel interface is associated with a VRF which is used to define and control what traffic is allowed to pass and how it should appear on the network. There is no attachment of the vnet interface to a node interface required but the virtual network does need to be attached to the node or cluster before the tunnel interface is created.</description></item><item><title>WireGuard</title><link>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/tunnels/wireguard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.trustgrid.io/docs/nodes/appliances/tunnels/wireguard/</guid><description>A WireGuard tunnel interface can be configured to allow a WireGuard client to connect to a Trustgrid Node running as a WireGuard server. The tunnel interface is associated with a VRF which is used to define and control what traffic is allowed to pass and how it should appear on the network.
