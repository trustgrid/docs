Password Complexity At least 10 characters in length Lower case (a-z), upper case (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) Special characters (-!@#$%^&amp;amp;*) No more than 2 identical characters in a row Cannot reuse the last 5 passwords Cannot be in the list of the 10,000 most common passwords Cannot include the userâ€™s name, username, or email address Multi-factor Authentication Requirements The Trustgrid native provider utilizes a One-time Password via applications such as Google Authenticator or similar to provide multi-factor authentication during login.</description></item></channel></rss>
